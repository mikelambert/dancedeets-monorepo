# These run through all our collected potential events and reload them, checking for what should be included.
# They will periodically refresh the event data to check for the latest values.
# Many times events get discovered in one of the earlier stages, but *too* early, when keywords/attendees don't trigger yet.
# This mapreduces is the "cleanup" that run through and reload them and guarantee they get rechecked.
# We could run it with expiry_days, but what's the point of re-running a classifier with cached data?
# Instead, let's run it with no cache, reloading all fb event/attending data, to then re-classify.
