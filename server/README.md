# DanceDeets

The magic behind <https://www.dancedeets.com/>.

## Setup

Download and install these libraries we depend on:
- <https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads>
  ...and open the AppEngine app at least once, to set up `/usr/local/google_appengine`.
- <https://nodejs.org/ja/download/>
- Download and install XCode from the App Store.

Second, setup our system-wide tools (maybe worth encapsulating in a script?):
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
gcloud config set project dancedeets-hrd
gcloud auth login
```

Third, to setup dancedeets:
- Make sure you are in the `server/` directory
- Run `./setup.sh`. It will download and install Python and JS libraries, as well as setup some other aspects of our build.
- Run `./setup_private.sh`. It will copy files from a shared Dropbox, which you will need to get access to. (It may fail due to the 'production' files, but the 'development' files should copy over.)

You can run a variety of commands from gulp:
- `gulp test` to run all of the included tests.
- `gulp server:hot` to run a local server (though you may want to run some `gulp:compile:webpack` commands below as well, particularly client and server)

Once you're running a server, you can load http://dev.dancedeets.com:8080/ in your browser.

If you are running the NLP classifier evaluations, you may want to setup re2 for speed.
To do this, download/install from <https://github.com/google/re2/>
Then install `pip install re2` to get the python wrappers.

## Running the Code

There are a variety of ways to run the server, depending on your needs/purposes.

### Overview

While the development servers often involve some magic for hot-reloading React, compiling JS/CSS in the background, there are only two moving parts to the production server, that are important to keep in mind:
- Javascript Backend, used for rendering React pages
- Python Web Server, that handles requests, and may call out to the Javascript Backend

### Clientside Javascript or Python
If you're developing python or Javascript code, just running this should be sufficient:
- `gulp server:hot`.

It will start a JS Backend and Python Web Server (alongside a Javascript FE Proxy that implements hot reloading of React JS)
Under the hood, it runs these three servers (only will matter to you if you want to run them directly in their own terminals, because one crashed, or because you want isolated logs):
- `gulp server:hot:node` (JS Backend)
- `gulp server:hot:python` (Python Web Server)
- `gulp server:hot:frontend` (FE Hot Reloading Proxy)

### CSS
If you're making any changes to the CSS, you'll need to setup the server for auto-rebuilding CSS:
- `gulp compile:webpack:client:debug:watch` (Recompile all JS/CSS code for Clients)

Note that rebuilding CSS is automatic, but it won't automatically reload into your web client. You'll need to reload the page to pick up any updated CSS.

### Less Common Cases
#### Serverside Javascript
Now we get into the trickier use cases...we use Isomorphic React, meaning we render the React code on the server using the JS Backend.
Unfortuantely, if you want to test server-side rendering, you'll need to generate the server-side React templates. This can be done by running:
- `gulp compile:webpack:server:debug:watch` (Recompile all JS/CSS code for Server)

#### AMP Pages
We also use AMP pages to help with our mobile audience. These require that we inline CSS into our AMP pages, which requires building special AMP-ified CSS. This can be done with the following command:
- `gulp compile:webpack:amp:debug:watch` (Recompile all JS/CSS code for AMP includes)

#### Production Versions
The above commands all build debug versions of the JS/CSS. This means they're easier to debug and read and work with. Unfortuantely, we do not want to push these up to the live site. And sometimes we may wish to debug JS/CSS as close to live as possible. This can be done by changing `debug` to `prod` in the above commands:
- `gulp compile:webpack:client:prod:watch` (Recompile all JS/CSS code for Clients)
- `gulp compile:webpack:server:prod:watch` (Recompile all JS/CSS code for Server)
- `gulp compile:webpack:amp:prod:watch` (Recompile all JS/CSS code for AMP includes)


## Code Layout

- [`assets/`](assets): The Frontend code, used by Webpack to build out the JS, CSS, and Images (written into [`dist/`](dist))
- [`amp/`](amp): Google AMP support tools
- [`brackets/`](brackets): Show youtube videos in a nice battle display format (exploratory code)
- [`battle_brackets/`](battle_brackets): Handle the server-side of the Battle Brackets I was building on mobile (exploratory code)
- [`classes/`](classes): Scrape and display the Class schedules in LA and NYC
- [`classifiers/`](classifiers): Help tune and tweak the keyword-based classifier. Not worth worrying about unless making changes there
- [`docker/`](docker): The docker images used by our project (Should set these up using [`gulpfile.babel.js`](gulpfile.babel.js))
- [`event_attendees/`](event_attendees): The attendee-based event classifier
- [`event_scraper/`](event_scraper): Scrapes the FB pages/groups, as well as the signed-in users' events, to find and classify events
- [`events/`](events): Event code (locations, reloading, adding/removing, images, etc). Everything not classifier/scraping-related.
- [`favorites/`](favorites): First attempt at setting up event-favoriting (exploratory code)
- [`geonames/`](geonames): Fetching and managing Geoname data
- [`hacks/`](hacks): Monkey patches and other hacks to fix bugs and get things working
- [`images/`](images): Old-but-still-used images (that aren't part of the [`assets/`](assets) setup)
- [`loc/`](loc): Location code (fetching from Google Maps API and Google Places API), caching, and some utility functions. Used by [`servlets/`](servlets), so this should not itself contain servlet code.
- [`logic/`](logic): Catch-all directory for code that didn't make it into another top-level directory yet.
- [`mail/`](mail): Mails users
- [`ml/`](ml): Unused code, when I was exploring using a now-defunct Google Classifier API
- [`nlp/`](nlp): Keyword-based classifier code
- [`node_server/`](node_server): The JS server that runs in the cloud. Used for rendering server-side React (and compiling MJML to valid email)
- [`notifications/`](notifications): Sends notifications to users (currently android-only)
- [`profiles/`](profiles): Support basic user profile pages (super-old exploratory code)
- [`pubsub/`](pubsub): Posts to Twitter and FB. Both weekly schedules, per-event additions, filtering critera, etc
- [`rankings/`](rankings): Rank cities by events and users, both calculation and display
- [`search/`](search): The event search functionality, built on top of GAE Search. Used to support city, location, style searches. As well as exploratory code for Page searches (beyond Event searches)
- [`services/`](services): Underlying services that we had to reimplement as we migrate of GAE Standard to GAE Flex
- [`servlets/`](servlets): Catch-all directory for servlet rendering code that didn't make it into another top-level directory yet. Depends on [`logic/`](logic).
- [`templates/`](templates): Jinja2 templates used to render the site. Many of the more complex rendering has been moved into React JS rendering in [`assets/`](assets).
- [`test_utils/`](test_utils): Reusable utility code for tests
- [`tools/`](tools): Generic scripts (not needed by the webserver itself)
- [`topics/`](topics): Topic Pages, aka Dancer pages (exploratory code)
- [`tutorials/`](tutorials): Tutorials, display and rendering.
- [`users/`](users): User code, for account management
- [`util/`](util): Util code, should have minimal dependencies, and be unrelated to DanceDeets business logic
- [`web_events/`](web_events): Web Events, distinct from FB Events, are events that come from scraped webpages. Primarily used for Korea and Japan.

Some important scripts:
- [`setup.sh`](setup.sh): A script to initialize the machine, directory, and get everything ready for development and pushing.
- [`setup.py`](setup.py): A script to package up the project for use on ScrapingHub. So only contains a subset of the code, mostly [`classes/`](classes/) stuff and dependencies.
- [`gulpfile.babel.js`](gulpfile.babel.js): Has most of the commands and build logic for the site.
- [`webpack.config.amp.babel.js`](webpack.config.amp.babel.js): Builds the AMP CSS (using Uncss), as a minified compressed CSS that can be inlined directly
- [`webpack.config.client.babel.js`](webpack.config.client.babel.js): Generates the client code (JS, CSS, Images) from [`assets/`](assets/).
- [`webpack.config.server.babel.js`](webpack.config.server.babel.js): Generates the React templates as server JS code (packaged up for easy running within [`node_server`](node_server))
