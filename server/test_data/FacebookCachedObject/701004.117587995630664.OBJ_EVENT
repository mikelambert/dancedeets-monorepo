The entrances to the hall are on Endcliffe Crescent, S10 3ED, and Caxton Road, S10 3DE.\n\nThe nearest car park is a couple of minutes\u2019 walk away at Endcliffe Village on Endcliffe Crescent, S10 3ED, or there is limited on street parking on the roads around the venue. The venue does not have its own car park.  \n\nBus routes 120, 51 and 52 stop nearby (from the city centre and Hillsborough/Crookes).\n\n***What's contra dancing?***\n\nContra dance is a form of lively social folk dancing, similar to ceilidhs or barn dances.  You dance with a partner within a group (usually a long line) of pairs of dancers, to energetic live music from great bands!\n\nThere is a \"caller\" (instructor) who teaches each dance.  They lead a walkthrough of the dance before the music starts, and give instructions during the dance. Our regular dancers are friendly and happy to help new dancers join in.  \n\nAnyone can ask anyone to dance, so you don't need to bring a partner.  Contra dancing is great exercise - we suggest comfortable, lightweight clothing and flat shoes.", "start_time": "2018-02-17T19:30:00+0000", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=d9edbd80e0f29f221dbf041f5ca96192&oe=5B055718", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 55, "id": "1589317654466284"}, "noreply_count": 81, "updated_time": "2018-02-08T23:42:14+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MzIwMTkxMzE2OTM0", "before": "NTI3MDEyMTg0MDMwMTc1"}}, "data": [{"id": "527012184030175", "name": "Sheffield Contra Dances - UK"}, {"id": "320191316934", "name": "Vertical Expression"}]}, "maybe_count": 37, "place": {"id": "144368458937760", "name": "Birkdale School", "location": {"city": "Sheffield", "zip": "S10 3DH", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -1.5049310390766, "street": "4 Oakholme Road", "latitude": 53.374402616332}}, "end_time": "2018-02-17T22:30:00+0000", "owner": {"name": "Sheffield Contra Dances - UK", "id": "527012184030175"}, "timezone": "Europe/London", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "117587995630664", "name": "Sheffield Contra dance with Vertical Expression & Rhodri Davies"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=1a61cbefed42004509cb20f200893e6f&oe=5B256289", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1589317654466284": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=20171c1e5bebb73b933bf2de5fe672ac&oe=5AD8C366", "width": 960, "height": 641}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=4352327851d7a06abd0004541358e950&oe=5B11DA54", "width": 898, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=5f41f1ac50a92e9cd56a626b27fbceed&oe=5B09A87D", "width": 718, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=c52a6d22557152876222491f099536ec&oe=5B160D3A", "width": 479, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=8792a6c76d336ecb154b9d3257e0dbd1&oe=5B1A7C71", "width": 808, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=7b9e73011e91b78c521682dff86555b6&oe=5B0B7ADD", "width": 194, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/21314389_1589317654466284_4474535113739850855_n.jpg?oh=e1145e2aa4882487ffa465f9a83d3335&oe=5B26BF6A", "width": 336, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1589317654466284", "height": 480}}, "empty": null}
