The dance fusion that involves partnering or dancing alone will help dancers to be more body conscious. Developing the sensibility/care, partnership, and correct lead with someone are only a few of the many things that dancers who are used to dancing alone will learn. For the dancers who are more comfortable with partnering, their focus will be more towards achieving different grooves/musicality.\n \nTo Aline and Charles, just like movement in dance, it\u2019s constantly changing, and because of that we weren\u2019t scared of \u201cerror\u201d or of escaping the norm and just experimenting on something new.\n \nIn their studies and training, they noticed several possibilities through the process of creation and improve. The most important part of this process was rediscovering potential in each of them. Him being the leader and her the follower in the dance they both find the liberty within the dance and equally divide the construction of movement, musicality and even the way to lead each other through the movement.  They both rediscovered that dance exist to liberate yourself from any limitations! Because of this they are constantly in search for new alternatives or in search for a dance that has no judgment/oppression that will continue with their study and passion towards dance.\n\nINDIVIDUAL BACKGROUNDS\n\nCHARLES\nCharles Espinoza was introduced to dance by his cousin in Brazil at the age of 15. Fascinated by the art form, Charles signed up for a Hip-Hop class at a local gym and hasn\u2019t stopped dancing since.
