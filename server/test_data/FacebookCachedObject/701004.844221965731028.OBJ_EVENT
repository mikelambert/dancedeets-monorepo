Ms. Sharif is a popular teacher both for her technique and her personable way of communicating with students! Her class design is unusually comprehensive including: technique, musicality, cultural awareness, context, costuming, & stage presence. Knowledgeable and accessible, she is a leading instructor in New York City, where she prepares students to perform Mr. Sharif's choreographies & Perform to Live Music.  Nourhan has  taught on nearly every continent and has performed globally to acclaimed audiences.  She is a faculty member of the Arab Dance Seminar which presents annually and is the Executive Producer  of the Sharif Annual Weeklong which takes place in NYC every summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nourhan is frequently engaged as a workshop instructor nationally and internationally, but is currently focusing on her New York projects with regards to teaching. She is intent upon presenting Egyptian properly, as it should be conceived, taught, and performed. Considered the perfect expression of Yousry Sharif's complex technique and eloquent style, she gives her dance students a solid foundation for growth in Middle Eastern dance technique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          All Nourhan's endeavors are designed to further, and disseminate, the art of Middle Eastern dance. She believes that Middle Eastern dancers are most successful when they know the cultural foundation of the dance and its music: Audiences respond best to dancers who are aware of Middle Eastern culture, those who are well-versed in the folkloric genres that gave rise to the Oriental style. She strives to impart her knowledge of the culture and folklore to her students, knowing that this awareness gives the dancer longevity and makes him/her stand out!  Thus, Dancers currently trained by Nourhan  are the best Egyptian Dancers NYC  has to offer !  Nourhan is currently writing a book as well and training the next generation of Egyptian Dancers!\n\nContact Lisa Vega at lisavegabellydance@gmail.com for any questions", "ticket_uri": "http://www.vegabellydance.com/nourhan-sharif.html", "start_time": "2018-04-21T10:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=36933c55787bdf5936c71e6dab285f16&oe=5B0E8F92", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 44, "id": "1864635420524339"}, "noreply_count": 74, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T09:56:28+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTQ0NjgyNzUyNTYzODQ2NgZDZD", "before": "MTQ0NjgyNzUyNTYzODQ2NgZDZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "1446827525638466", "name": "Lisa Vega Bellydance"}]}, "maybe_count": 93, "place": {"id": "1446827525638466", "name": "Lisa Vega Bellydance", "location": {"city": "Ocean Springs", "zip": "39564", "country": "United States", "longitude": -88.82975, "state": "MS", "street": "6616 Rose Farm Rd", "latitude": 30.43759, "located_in": "457175991131393"}}, "end_time": "2018-04-22T15:30:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Lisa Vega Bellydance", "id": "1446827525638466"}, "timezone": "America/Chicago", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "844221965731028", "name": "Nourhan Sharif Workshops and Show!"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.36.200.200/p200x200/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=5750992a4f70c990be1833b592ba7c49&oe=5B08CB64", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1864635420524339": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=36933c55787bdf5936c71e6dab285f16&oe=5B0E8F92", "width": 402, "height": 604}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=19497dc8422d7c312ca8f69568afa566&oe=5B1EDACE", "width": 320, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=73015406c4575a587211fc0753af6388&oe=5B0E8185", "width": 359, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=501db4abcbc56f4652757d2bec911f48&oe=5B113129", "width": 130, "height": 195}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/18950991_1864635420524339_7982239633388214990_n.jpg?oh=f7f60958199f3ed387a0a1df3adf692a&oe=5B0D889E", "width": 149, "height": 225}], "width": 402, "id": "1864635420524339", "height": 604}}, "empty": null}
