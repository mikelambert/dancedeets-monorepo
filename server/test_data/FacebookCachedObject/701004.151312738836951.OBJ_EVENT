Sahra's unique perspective follows how the dance transforms from the homes of the people to the sparkling stages of Cairo.\n\nThe dances studied include:\nBedouin\nGhawazee\nCairo\nSaidi\nNubian\nHaggallah\nSuez Canal\nFellahin\n\nThese dances are put into the context of the local culture and histories. Their transformation from homestyle to the stage is also covered in depth. For several of the dances the students break from lecture to stretch their muscles and learn the movements that can traditionally be found in these dances. The way that these dances have been interpreted and adapted for the stage is also discussed and shown.\n\nThe course also covers many of the rights and rituals that can be found throughout Egypt, such as zeffah, zars, and moulids. Whenever possible, these rituals are described and explained with video Sahra has taken on one of her own research journeys to Egypt. Here youll find a play by play of what youre seeing and how it is affected by culture and peoples perceptions.\n\nhttp://journeythroughegypt.com/courses-workshops/journey-through-egypt/journey-through-egypt-1-2/ \n\nTickets are available at the Aalim studio during normal business hours and http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2960624.  \n\nEarly Bird $300.00 before January 1, 2018.
