There will be DJ slots from Joe Collins & Jaime, plus a warm up class with Joe Collins at 8pm, and freestyle from 8:45 - 11:30pm. Tea, coffee and sweet treats will be available during the evening too.  It\u2019s set to be a popular night, and a great escape over the Easter weekend so we hope to see you there.\r\n\r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nWhen I turned 40 last April, I looked at my life and decided it was a good year to do something drastic! After considering emigrating with the family, or starting a degree course, I decided to pick something from my bucket list - The London Marathon! Aside from ticking one more dream off the list, and transforming me in to a fitness goddess (or so i\u2019d hoped), I knew I\u2019d need a big driving force to put myself through training for the 26.2 mile course. I had to find a charity that means a lot to me.\r\n\r\nLike all great things that happen in life, the answer began to evolve by itself. Back in 2007 I started a nanny job for a fabulous family of six, who shortly after I started working with them became a family of seven. Gabriella was born (she was such a gorgeous little baby girl), and she and I quickly became the best of buddies. I cared for her until she was six years old and during this time, Gabby and her family became beyond special to me. They hold the reason for me to complete the London Marathon, because at the age of three, Gabby was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Neurofibromatosis (NF) and The Neuro foundation?\r\n\r\nNF is a genetic condition that few people have heard of, yet it\u2019s more common than cystic fibrosis. One in every 2500 births produces a child with NF, either inheriting it from a parent or as a result of a genetic gene mutation at birth. There are two main types, NF1 and NF2. NF1 means those afflicted have a gene mutation in chromosome 17.  People living with NF1 often have learning difficulties and have 'cafe au lait\u2019 birth marks across their body, but for many NF sufferers there are much more serious medical symptoms, most commonly the development of benign tumours and neurofibromas growing along nerves both inside or outside the body, often causing severe pain. It can also cause deformity of the bones and spinal problems, disfigurement (if tumours develop in the face for example), epilepsy and medical conditions resulting from the position of the tumours in the body. A lot of people living with this condition also have numerous social and communication issues.\r\n\r\nThe Neuro Foundation supports children and families living with neurofibromatosis by providing specialist nurses, information days, counselling, vital communication links and much, much more. Without their support, those with NF would be living in a very lonely world. It gives hope and direction and helps us all in our fight to one day END NF.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it\u2019s effected my friend, Gabriella.\r\n\r\nAt aged 7, Gabriella\u2019s family were devastated to discover that she had a large brain tumour which blocked both her hypothalamus and her pituitory glands which has caused multiple medical complications, and which remains worryingly close to her eyes. The tumour itself is inoperable because of its position, but if it grows, as it is likely to do, Gaby will inevitably have to have chemotherapy. She has had so many problems and has spent an inordinate amount of time in hospital, with constant lengthy MRI scans, visits to endocrinologists, neurologists, opthamologists, and oncologists, each helping to manage and monitor her problems. Despite all this, Gaby puts a smile on her face every single day and sees the positive in everything and everyone, but its a tough battle for her with much worse to come. \r\n\r\nPlease by tickets to my event, to help one day put an end to NF.  Your support will help to make that vision a reality, and make my marathon journey as worth while as it can be.
