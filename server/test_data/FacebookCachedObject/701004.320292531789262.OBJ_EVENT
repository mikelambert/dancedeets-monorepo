This class will cover some basic aesthetics of blues dancing (helping distinguish what is similar to and different from lindy hop), as well as some common movements and variations for blues. At the end of this class, you'll come away with a better understanding of what makes something look 'bluesy' or not, and you'll have new movements that you can bring into your partner dancing.\r\n\r\n-11:00 - 12:00: A taste of Jukin'-\r\nJukin\u2019 is a sub-style of blues dancing that was danced in juke joints, house parties, and other small social spaces. Danced to guitar, harmonica, and piano-based blues, this style incorporates a lot of solo movements and has greater independence between partners. In this class, we'll bring solo movements from the first class into our partner dancing, as we explore how we lead, follow, & interact in this sub-style.\r\n\r\n-12:00 - 2:00: Break-\r\n\r\n-2:00 - 3:00: Close embrace connection-\r\nClose embrace is an important connection for blues dancing, but it's not always easy to get comfortable at first. Come learn how to create a comfortable close embrace connection for yourself and your partner, as well as how to tell if your partner is comfortable in the connection and how make adjustments to address that.\r\n\r\n-3:00 - 4:00: A taste of Ballroomin' -\r\nBallroomin' is the other main sub-style of blues dancing, danced in (you guessed it) ballrooms! Danced to jazz-blues, this style has more specific partnering and often moves around the dance floor. In this class, we'll learn one or two ballroomin' blues dances for traveling the floor.\r\n\r\nSUN\r\n-11:00 - 12:00: Expression & creativity in Jukin'-\r\nBuilding off of yesterday's class, we'll explore a few of the ways we can express ourselves and bring more personal style to our dancing in Jukin', both for followers and for leaders.\r\n\r\n-12:00 - 1:00: Expression & creativity in Ballroomin'-\r\nBuilding off of yesterday's class, we'll explore a few of the ways we can express ourselves and bring more personal style to our dancing in Ballroomin', both for followers and for leaders.", "start_time": "2018-02-23T20:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/25398189_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_o.jpg?oh=bdf0a138ae4c76ea699c962a6d5c8492&oe=5B1E1ACE", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 33, "id": "10156228626659050"}, "noreply_count": 463, "updated_time": "2018-02-10T23:26:25+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTQzMjgwNDM4MDg0NTYZD", "before": "MTgxNjcwMDE5MDEzOTgz"}}, "data": [{"id": "181670019013983", "name": "Christopher Touros"}, {"id": "886251844721309", "name": "Allison May Cruz"}, {"id": "10153244093529050", "name": "Erin Concelman"}, {"id": "10154328043808456", "name": "John Constantine"}]}, "maybe_count": 237, "place": {"id": "108288992526695", "name": "Orlando, FL", "location": {"city": "Orlando", "zip": "32801\u201332899", "country": "United States", "longitude": -81.3758, "state": "FL", "latitude": 28.5335}}, "end_time": "2018-02-25T23:00:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Erin Concelman", "id": "10153244093529050"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "320292531789262", "name": "Break Even Blues"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.0.200.200/p200x200/25443134_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_n.jpg?oh=eaa7f1ce1759dc847db0b7175c94fb34&oe=5B03C721", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10156228626659050": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25398189_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_o.jpg?oh=a71ade8b4a18be339f97fc9734dc540c&oe=5ADA1A1C", "width": 1582, "height": 2048}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p960x960/25398189_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_o.jpg?oh=856922b9487a896973e5e596c8f539a8&oe=5B1AD6DC", "width": 960, "height": 1242}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/25398189_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_o.jpg?oh=4121d8c76e377c67457d3fb0c453d050&oe=5B15668F", "width": 720, "height": 932}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/25398189_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_o.jpg?oh=b7aa06707cb644b04946fa00402d25fd&oe=5B124836", "width": 600, "height": 776}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/25443134_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_n.jpg?oh=f7a17918e317fdec5baedf88aa35ba4d&oe=5B0C57A3", "width": 480, "height": 621}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/25443134_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_n.jpg?oh=38a07045cca9e32f137276b6ad178b8b&oe=5B26C2E1", "width": 320, "height": 414}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/25443134_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_n.jpg?oh=f334b243643140035f3b9a01a6c7cdbe&oe=5B1A2EC4", "width": 416, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/25443134_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_n.jpg?oh=76561ee4645ea1608a28348acd8b45fb&oe=5B0865F1", "width": 130, "height": 168}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/25443134_10156228626659050_5450991367614283515_n.jpg?oh=bb5a56dcc7402a5c185969deba817a89&oe=5B1B3847", "width": 173, "height": 225}], "width": 556, "id": "10156228626659050", "height": 720}}, "empty": null}
