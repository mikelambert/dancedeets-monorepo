Keel has absorbed the best lessons from his Bluegrass family upbringing, both sides deeply steeped in the rich mountain music culture and heritage of Southwest Virginia. From there, he has always integrated that solid musical grounding and natural-born talent with his own incomparable approach to playing amplified, acoustic guitar and composing original music. He's also got a knack for choosing interesting and appealing material from all realms of music with guts, whether it's a tune written by a fellow song-writer/musician friend, or a surprise cover from any number of musical acts all over the map. The combination is pretty irresistible, and has earned Keel the highest respect and billing among the top acoustic and jam rock musicians alive, and some now gone: Tony Rice, Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tim O\u2019Brien, Vassar Clements, Sam Bush, Del McCoury, John Hartford, Bill Monroe, Peter Rowan, and Danny Barnes to name a few. And his fierce, high-spirited energy also appeals to young rockers, jammers and alt-country pickers and fans who are equally drawn to Keel\u2019s blazing guitar power, the deep rumbling voice, his earthy and expansive song-writing, and his down-home-gritty-good-time charm. Keel convenes and collaborates with JamBand and Rock giants Greensky Bluegrass, Infamous Stringdusters, Yonder Mountain String Band, Keller Williams, Jorma Kaukonen, David Nelson, Little Feat, Railroad Earth, String Cheese Incident, Fruition and Leftover Salmon, amongst others.\n\nKeel has a variety of musical formats he presents throughout the year; look out for his core band The Larry Keel Experience (featuring award-winning and highly accomplished Jared Pool on mandolin and penetrating vocals, and wife Jenny Keel with her rock solid bass lines as well as tenor vocal harmonies), Larry Does Jerry (Keel performing the music for Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead), Larry and the Smokin\u2019 J\u2019s (featuring Jon Stickley, Jay Starling and Jared Pool), Keller Williams and the Keels, and steady swirl of pairings with Keel and Drew Emmitt, Andy Thorn, Danny Barnes, members of the Del McCoury Band, Steep Canyon Rangers, just to name a few. Of note for early 2017 is Keel\u2019s top billing at New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall, where he will headline along with Al Di Meola, Stefane Wrembel and Stochelo Rosenberg at the Django A Go-Go concert, celebrating Django Reinhardt\u2019s influence on the world of guitar music. \n\nThroughout his career, Keel has released 15 albums and is featured on 10 others. The most recent release, March 2016, is EXPERIENCED, an entirely original work that showcases Larry\u2019s and banjo virtuoso Will Lee\u2019s exceptional songwriting, singing and jaw-dropping instrumental performances, accompanied by Keel\u2019s equally talented wife Jenny Keel on upright bass and harmony vocals. This Americana Radio charting album exemplifies the raw sophistication of Keel\u2019s progressive acoustic style, and features musician-friends who appear as guests on various tracks of Experienced; the artists include Sam Bush, Del McCoury, Peter Rowan, Keller Williams, Jason Carter (Del McCoury Band), Mike Guggino (Steep Canyon Rangers) and Anders Beck (Greensky Bluegrass). Quotes about Keel and his music from these artists themselves capture the essence of what this album and Keel\u2019s artistry represents:\n\n\u201cLarry Keel is a triple threat\u2026 songwriter, guitar player, entertainer. He can do it all.\u201d \u2014 Del McCoury\n\n\u201cLarry is a true original, be it traditional, progressive, improv.. he does it all, and with such joy. I love jamming with Keel. Enjoy the music. Larry does.\u201d \u2014 Sam Bush\n\n\u201cLarry is the yin and the yang.. he will break your heart with a waltz, but he can also scare the hell out of you in the next song. He plays on the edge.. no, strike that- he creates genius guitar solos while staring over the edge and laughing maniacally.\u201d \u2014 Anders Beck, Greensky Bluegrass\n\nFor Keel the musical mission is always clear: to let natural ability, finely-honed skill, honest emotion and fearlessness connect the playing and singing to audiences, to entertain and to thoroughly enjoy the experience of creating and sharing in music.", "ticket_uri": "https://tikly.co/events/2563", "start_time": "2018-04-14T20:00:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=046c62c624daa16f4c44494d169f123c&oe=5ADA4D58", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 43, "id": "1658021100887588"}, "noreply_count": 6, "updated_time": "2018-01-31T22:48:10+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTE4MDQxMTIxNTQ3Njk4", "before": "NTkyNDA5NTQ0MTE1NDIx"}}, "data": [{"id": "592409544115421", "name": "The Willow Tree Coffeehouse and Music Room"}, {"id": "118041121547698", "name": "Larry Keel"}]}, "maybe_count": 96, "place": {"id": "592409544115421", "name": "The Willow Tree Coffeehouse and Music Room", "location": {"city": "Johnson City", "zip": "37604", "country": "United States", "longitude": -82.35164, "state": "TN", "street": "216 E Main St", "latitude": 36.31651}}, "end_time": "2018-04-14T23:00:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "The Willow Tree Coffeehouse and Music Room", "id": "592409544115421"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "162172367751971", "name": "The Larry Keel Experience is coming to The Willow Tree!"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p200x200/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=24c86a7733fcada4341421ed456cfd1b&oe=5B267801", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1658021100887588": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=28de3137c9e84d56b350ea243f49ceae&oe=5B1083F6", "width": 960, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=046c62c624daa16f4c44494d169f123c&oe=5ADA4D58", "width": 720, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=979f95141e96d5913edba6a5088a4ed0&oe=5B1861C4", "width": 600, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=578cd061170387dbfab10990935c9dc6&oe=5B1AA0ED", "width": 480, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=7a7fcfdb679e7ab4de536f95f3912f92&oe=5B26B9AA", "width": 320, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=0547da768124e31b9c5fa25e418397a8&oe=5B131CE1", "width": 540, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=0fdf357e5b219c5ff5f74494ef3c1c82&oe=5B04E04D", "width": 130, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27336207_1658021100887588_3379035096114117781_n.jpg?oh=ef1747e61a8432f14db6991c12fdebfd&oe=5B1066FA", "width": 225, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1658021100887588", "height": 720}}, "empty": null}
