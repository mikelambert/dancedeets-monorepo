It is a tango social dance event where neotango, nuevo tango and contemporary tango music is played as well as some music not usually associated with tango.\n\nArgentine tango is a vibrant and playful dance between two people. It has a rich potential for expression, improvisation and connection and is danced in both modern and traditional styles. It is often described as a passionate dance, because of the close connection partners can have, the character of the music, and also relating to some of the dance's history.\n\nFor more information: Tonya Miller, 615-419-5103, millertonya@hotmail.com\n\nNote: After 9pm, Play Dance Bar sometimes cards people at the door so bring ID.
