Jaige and Adam have been playing music together since 2001 for dances, festivals and concerts throughout North America and abroad, predominantly with the band Crowfoot.  We are excited to have the opportunity to host them at Sheffield Contras!\n\nAndrew Swaine is one of the UK's top contra callers and we are very happy to welcome him back to Sheffield Contras.  He is known for his clear, friendly calling style and his ability to ensure that complete beginners and experienced dancers alike can all join in and enjoy the dancing.\n\n**Practical info**\n\nAt Heeley Hall, BIrkdale School, Sheffield (entrances on Caxton Road S10 3DE and Endcliffe Crescent S10 3ED).  Parking available at Endcliffe Student Village on Endcliffe Crescent.\n\n7.30-10.30pm, \u00a39 (\u00a37 students) pay on the door, bring your own drinks, bring your friends!  Half price entry for people who haven't been to a Sheffield Contra before, or who bring a friend who hasn't.  \n\nNew dancers are very welcome, all dances are called (taught) so no previous contra dance experience is necessary.\n\n**What's contra?**\n\nContra dance is a form of lively social folk dancing, similar to ceilidhs or barn dances. You dance with a partner within a group (usually a long line) of pairs of dancers, to energetic live music from great bands!\n\nThere is a \u201ccaller\u201d (instructor) who teaches each dance, so you don\u2019t have to have done contra dancing before to be able to join in. They lead a walkthrough of the dance before the music starts, and give instructions during the dance. Our regular dancers are friendly and happy to help new dancers join in.\n\nAnyone can ask anyone to dance, so you don\u2019t need to bring a partner. Contra dancing is great exercise \u2013 we suggest comfortable, lightweight clothing and flat shoes.\n\nHave a look at this page and our website to see some videos of past events: http://www.sheffieldcontradances.co.uk/whats-contra/", "start_time": "2018-03-17T19:30:00+0000", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q83/p235x350/26233516_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_o.jpg?oh=6879daea522797788bd1a04daa84aec2&oe=5B14F7AF", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0, "id": "1718310144900367"}, "noreply_count": 77, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T00:30:13+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NTI3MDEyMTg0MDMwMTc1", "before": "NTI3MDEyMTg0MDMwMTc1"}}, "data": [{"id": "527012184030175", "name": "Sheffield Contra Dances - UK"}]}, "maybe_count": 9, "place": {"name": "Heeley Hall, Birkdale School, Caxton Road/Endcliffe Crescent, Sheffield S10 4DE"}, "end_time": "2018-03-17T22:30:00+0000", "owner": {"name": "Sheffield Contra Dances - UK", "id": "527012184030175"}, "timezone": "Europe/London", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "209776569587193", "name": "Sheffield Contra dance with Maivish & Andrew Swaine"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q83/c118.0.200.200/p200x200/26230040_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_n.jpg?oh=90f7ecde2b5d467c5c6d9f46ecd5b5c6&oe=5B1E521F", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1718310144900367": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26233516_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_o.jpg?oh=b9012ec9573dd0a68b875fd8298c14b6&oe=5AD9EAD7", "width": 1181, "height": 575}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q83/p480x480/26233516_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_o.jpg?oh=216ece6443f9790c52f3f9a2fd3214f5&oe=5B13177C", "width": 985, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q83/p320x320/26233516_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_o.jpg?oh=14415128a6840fb84d7157a7c0f05518&oe=5B17B03B", "width": 657, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q83/p180x540/26233516_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_o.jpg?oh=4f87e121f067110e026eaa56b4e70c90&oe=5B268670", "width": 1109, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q83/p130x130/26230040_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_n.jpg?oh=04ed941d17937b08594ea066db6ddeec&oe=5B0478C2", "width": 267, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q83/p75x225/26230040_1718310144900367_1491011799393147360_n.jpg?oh=b4faab66a91f904ecd4fbb7acdcda2cf&oe=5AD96F9C", "width": 462, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1718310144900367", "height": 350}}, "empty": null}
