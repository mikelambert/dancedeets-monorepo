Some of the pieces are through-composed and completely written out while others are through-composed but with ample space for Tigran to improvise. Many include vocals layered into the mix. Like most of his recordings, the influences of the music are manifold, ranging from classical Baroque dance to J-Dilla-esque hip-hop grooves adapted to piano to a few tracks with pedals connected to a synthesizer\u2014though the Armenian influence, which makes his music so uniquely outstanding, is prominent.\n\nConceptually, The Ancient Observer is a poignant album focusing on the art of observing. \u201cIt\u2019s something that humans have been practicing for ages, sometimes even subliminally,\u201d Tigran says. \u201cIt is especially interesting now in 2016. It\u2019s the feeling of the ancient eternal and impermanent versus the present day eternal and the impermanent. The intertwining of this ancient with the modern world creates an existential feeling. This album is presenting the observation of the world we live in now and the weight of our history we carry on our shoulders, which is influencing us even if we don't realize it. This album is the observation of influences and experiences I had.\u201d\n\n\"Tigran, you are my teacher now!\" - Herbie Hancock\n\nhttp://www.tigranhamasyan.com/", "ticket_uri": "http://ticketf.ly/2j7y5kT", "start_time": "2018-02-28T20:30:00-0600", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/23334078_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_o.jpg?oh=66a2914fe22870dd06b35dd16725ac45&oe=5B049D64", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0, "id": "10159835091975227"}, "noreply_count": 5, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T23:58:11+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTA2OTE1Mjk2MDAxNzcy", "before": "NTI2NzgwMDE0MDM4OTU2"}}, "data": [{"id": "526780014038956", "name": "Constellation Chicago"}, {"id": "270759232963511", "name": "GiantSteps"}, {"id": "106915296001772", "name": "Tigran Hamasyan"}]}, "maybe_count": 306, "place": {"id": "526780014038956", "name": "Constellation Chicago", "location": {"city": "Chicago", "zip": "60618", "country": "United States", "longitude": -87.68763, "state": "IL", "street": "3111 N Western Ave", "latitude": 41.9381}}, "owner": {"category": "Entertainment", "link": "http://www.ticketfly.com/", "name": "Ticketfly Backstage Amplifier", "id": "246250972265"}, "timezone": "America/Chicago", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1981960805414280", "name": "Tigran Hamasyan at Constellation"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p200x200/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=4a845823459a540e498d963051cbd7aa&oe=5B0BB509", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10159835091975227": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/23334078_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_o.jpg?oh=0aab7c98e88596359de5791808fe7f9a&oe=5B1266F7", "width": 1500, "height": 1500}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=20fcf720bfcfbcccaed0183e3f6e7d97&oe=5B1AF324", "width": 960, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/23334078_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_o.jpg?oh=66a2914fe22870dd06b35dd16725ac45&oe=5B049D64", "width": 720, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=b65c3fbbe658b182a434df2029961ce3&oe=5B0690EB", "width": 600, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=ba46e4b9db628e2dc729b794ae09bad9&oe=5B1140D1", "width": 480, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=becda897c361ff9116accdc480a04536&oe=5B181293", "width": 320, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=07c6bf007062884c7b0775d8de30b334&oe=5B064AB6", "width": 540, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=f26ca2516ddc86aca74b9cd98829b580&oe=5B1B4983", "width": 130, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/23376277_10159835091975227_6127318028790641891_n.jpg?oh=43c8100480bb5875f443ff7fd13ec931&oe=5B202135", "width": 225, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "10159835091975227", "height": 720}}, "empty": null}
