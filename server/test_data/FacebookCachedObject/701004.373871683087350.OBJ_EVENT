For more information or to reserve a seat, email Jimmy at jlspearow@att.net.\n\nWe have a special treat this week! Join us for Joyce Miller calling to the music of Ryan McKasson and Eric McDonald. The cost is  $12 for adults; $8 for college students with ID; $5 for dancers under 18; $25 maximum for families (cash or check).\n\nWe\u2019ll kick off the night\u2019s festivities with a community potluck, starting at 6:30 pm in the Nevada City Room of the Coloma Community Center. Please bring a dish to share, along with serving utensils. You may also bring your own table setting to save on disposables.\n\nRyan McKasson of the Syncopaths (fiddle) and Eric McDonald (guitar and mandolin) are masters of tradition who purposefully explore the dark corners floating on its edges. Their individual artistry is enhanced when they play together, resulting in an alluring complexity, full of spontaneous musicality. Pulling from parallel strands of influence, they create a swirling intensity that traverses darkness, light, and everywhere in between. \n\nJoyce Miller has been calling for contra dances since 2000, starting under the tutelage of Eric Curl. She has called at dance camps in the U.S. and Canada, but what she likes most is to call for her friends in the Sierra Foothills and environs. \n\nA newcomer\u2019s orientation is offered at 7:30 pm, perfect for people who have not contra danced before, or who could use some refresher. Experienced dancers are invited to partner with newcomers during the orientation and early dances to help integrate them into the community.\n\nNo partners are needed, so come by yourself or with friends or with family. Potluck snacks are available at the break, and we encourage you to bring something to share. These events are accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nFor more information, and lost and found, contact Laura Leonelli, 916-549-7093, or email info@sactocds.org\n\nUpcoming events:\nFebruary 24: advanced contra moves workshop and dance\nMarch 4: English country dance\nMarch 10: contra dance\n\nOur calendar is at https://sactocds.wordpress.com/calendar.", "start_time": "2018-02-10T20:00:00-0800", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=72aa3d19b1556527d9290b170700fe47&oe=5B16B527", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1811083715628862"}, "noreply_count": 0, "updated_time": "2018-02-05T00:34:50+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTM5MzkzNTg5NDY0NTU4", "before": "MTM5MzkzNTg5NDY0NTU4"}}, "data": [{"id": "139393589464558", "name": "Sacramento Country Dance Society"}]}, "maybe_count": 18, "place": {"id": "190920984332151", "name": "Coloma Community Center", "location": {"city": "Sacramento", "zip": "95819", "country": "United States", "longitude": -121.45121, "state": "CA", "street": "4623 T St", "latitude": 38.55664}}, "end_time": "2018-02-10T23:00:00-0800", "owner": {"name": "Sacramento Country Dance Society", "id": "139393589464558"}, "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "373871683087350", "name": "February 10th contra dance & potluck"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/c122.0.200.200/p200x200/27544796_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_n.jpg?oh=5fdaf85979158e6dbc3cb0b5d55186a5&oe=5B127C2F", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1811083715628862": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=2564072eba7e89a8cf7d147f70de6ccd&oe=5B25443B", "width": 2000, "height": 900}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=4a03f51b09c9a1d17d2391a6d453c2d1&oe=5AD96DF7", "width": 1600, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q83/p600x600/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=ba75f5433da9e2298116699e07923de1&oe=5B1A64B9", "width": 1333, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q83/p480x480/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=392065562dbb9b51f613d943a6f50e6b&oe=5B108590", "width": 1066, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q82/p320x320/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=f9797b6976f627514252963d6cf32cfb&oe=5B032CA7", "width": 711, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q82/p180x540/27709740_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_o.jpg?oh=81bad82b488f4620e043bb5ba4f21a9d&oe=5B11C5EC", "width": 1200, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/p130x130/27544796_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_n.jpg?oh=f2b7dbdfec8084a37d1c48bae1761bdb&oe=5B25EAC5", "width": 288, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/p75x225/27544796_1811083715628862_7461973586225033034_n.jpg?oh=631a40c71df80ae97857453861fb7f7c&oe=5B19B6D4", "width": 500, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1811083715628862", "height": 324}}, "empty": null}
