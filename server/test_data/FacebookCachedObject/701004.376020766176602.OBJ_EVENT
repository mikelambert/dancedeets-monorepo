You will find that the dance improves your posture, balance and confidence, and is a very enjoyable social activity. \n\nDuring this 4-week introductory course tutors Alison and Patrick will cover: posture, connection, intention of lead and follow, basic walking technique, embrace, musicality, and improvisation.The basic steps/combinations we teach are: paso basica (basic 8 steps), rock step, forward ocho, box step, backward ocho, parada, pasada, giros (turns) and walking turns. By the end of the course you will be able to link these steps and figures to suit the music and enjoy social dancing. \n\nEach lesson will last one hour followed by 30 minutes guided practice so that you can consolidate what you have learnt.\n\nWear comfortable, loose clothes and shoes with a slippy sole (trainers are too grippy). No stiletto heeled shoes please.\n\nArgentine Tango is danced in a close embrace, so ages 18 and over only please.\n\nTangoNess is a community dance group providing lessons, workshops and social dances for our members. We teach Argentine Tango for social occasions. It is an improvised walking dance and includes steps and figures that are appropriate and safe for a busy dance floor.\n\nThe cost for the 4 week course is \u00a325 and MUST be booked in advance.\n\nTo book the course email CraigmonieCC@highlifehighland.com to pay by cash or cheque. \n\nTo pay by Credit Card follow this link (High Life Highland Card Holders Only - you will need your membership number and PIN to book)  https://booking.highlifehighland.com/newlogin/", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-02-10T10:00:00+0000", "id": "376020789509933", "end_time": "2018-02-10T11:30:00+0000"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-03T10:00:00+0000", "id": "376020786176600", "end_time": "2018-02-03T11:30:00+0000"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-27T10:00:00+0000", "id": "376020782843267", "end_time": "2018-01-27T11:30:00+0000"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-20T10:00:00+0000", "id": "376020779509934", "end_time": "2018-01-20T11:30:00+0000"}], "start_time": "2018-01-20T10:00:00+0000", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=d4a5d78da9907ef07ba75758e0b1a38b&oe=5B23483F", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1893252994336769"}, "noreply_count": 0, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T20:48:27+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTYwNzc5Nzc2Mjg4MjI5NQZDZD", "before": "MTYwNzc5Nzc2Mjg4MjI5NQZDZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "1607797762882295", "name": "Craigmonie Centre Loch Ness"}]}, "maybe_count": 0, "place": {"id": "1761958694037084", "name": "Craigmonie Centre", "location": {"city": "Inverness", "zip": "IV63 6XA", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -4.484615, "street": "The Craigmonie Centre, Glen Urquhart High School", "latitude": 57.328161}}, "end_time": "2018-02-10T11:30:00+0000", "owner": {"name": "Craigmonie Centre Loch Ness", "id": "1607797762882295"}, "timezone": "Europe/London", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "376020766176602", "name": "Argentine Tango - Introductory Course"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/24909946_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_n.jpg?oh=34c08ee1467305e1af879b032d911b08&oe=5B192B95", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1893252994336769": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=13dfc1f98515efcd8d321e272015516e&oe=5B116423", "width": 2048, "height": 1362}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p960x960/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=b37743a6f9f05ae6d39600789fbbb065&oe=5B0D02F6", "width": 1443, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=82037a9f4e210562c25ebb3d9c98a902&oe=5B058DEF", "width": 1082, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=72b2f8e7944d85416111e915c27a7fbc&oe=5B1A7D03", "width": 902, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=705e3745bc52d8911717455072d31903&oe=5B15172A", "width": 721, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/24909946_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_n.jpg?oh=f202cfc31c8ac5a00aebf0d7d677a06d&oe=5B0A0A26", "width": 481, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/25188660_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_o.jpg?oh=7742b38d48d411e980c846e7998793a4&oe=5B1BAE26", "width": 811, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/24909946_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_n.jpg?oh=630f07b79c7b957a8088efe4d390a67b&oe=5B17B5C1", "width": 195, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/24909946_1893252994336769_2692206847517363322_n.jpg?oh=e9cd1a16ba98b45ea68c4123eef87d55&oe=5ADBAF76", "width": 338, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1893252994336769", "height": 478}}, "empty": null}
