The Batizado is an initiation ritual and ceremony which has evolved a lot over the centuries and is still honoured in the practice of Capoeira in a modern and global context. A student's Batizado (Baptism) is the first time a student plays inside the Roda (Capoeira Playing Circle) with a Mestre de Capoeira (Master of Capoeira). In this way, it is a rite of passage. Often, a student may receive an apelido, a new nickname that they become known by in the Capoeira World. In the past, students would train for many months before they set foot in the Roda. Today, although students may have experience playing inside the Roda, the Batizado is considered their first real experience of the Jogo de Capoeira (Game of Capoeira). It is the official initiation, welcome and blessing by the School. All new beginners are eligible to participate in the Batizado and receive their initial belt. Another important aspect of the Batizado is the Troca de Corda (Exchange of Belt). Mestres or Professors play one or more games with the older students and acknowledge their achievements by awarding them higher belts.\n\nAluai\u00ea Capoeira Batizado is mandatory for all the students of the academy who want to continue their development in Capoeira.\n\nPlease book your place in advance to avoid disappointment by either sending a text (mobile: 07502242102) or email (mail@aluaieuk.com) with your name and date(s) you will be participating.", "ticket_uri": "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/vi-cultural-exchange-aluaie-capoeira-london-tickets-42996765483?aff=es2", "start_time": "2018-04-26T18:00:00+0100", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/26731547_10212308316796864_8621112538522369739_n.jpg?oh=0ae446750aaa1d9f7f0b0bd40368c2cc&oe=5B109C27", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "10212308316796864"}, "noreply_count": 10, "updated_time": "2018-02-08T19:29:20+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTUxMTk2ODY1NzgwNTMZD", "before": "MTAzNzQzMTk5NzE1NTQ2"}}, "data": [{"id": "103743199715546", "name": "Aluai\u00ea Capoeira Academy UK"}, {"id": "10207946459762998", "name": "Balint Szule"}, {"id": "10155773496435210", "name": "Geoff Canguru Istas"}, {"id": "10153993250798653", "name": "Vimal Gohil Limao Aluaie"}, {"id": "10155119686578053", "name": "Laura Ayuso"}]}, "maybe_count": 34, "place": {"id": "103743199715546", "name": "Aluai\u00ea Capoeira Academy UK", "location": {"city": "London", "zip": "Se17 3py", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -0.0987875, "street": "29a Amelia Steet.
