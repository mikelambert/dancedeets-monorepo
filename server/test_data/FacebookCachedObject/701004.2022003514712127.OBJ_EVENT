We will focus on specific hip and spine moves to improve how we do them. Moving through space and turning with confidence and grace is also one of our themes. \nIntermediate/Advanced level  \n1-5.30pm \u00a342\nWe will build on the basic material and learn some advanced hip moves to add to our repertoire. Using a combination of choreography and improvisation we will develop a complete dance piece to an inpiring piece of music. \n\nSunday 11th March: Folk with Stick\nIntermediate/Advanced level\n1-5pm \u00a338\nWe are going to have fun using the stick for part of the time. Originally the stick (tahtib) was used in the male form of the folk dance in a playful combat style dance. The use of the stick has successfully been integrated in the female form of the dance. It adds another dimension of interest and expression.  We are going to learn a fun choreography. Please let us know if you need to borrow a stick!\n\nREDUCED PRICE if you book for Sat/Sun: \u00a368\nBooking: Please ring Anne on 0131 553 2770 or email: tianne25@hotmail.co.uk\nBank details: Edinburgh Egyptian Dancers, TSB, sort 30 25 81 account 0001 0513\n\nPlease secure your place and pay by 31st Jan 2018.  \n\nVenue: Granton Parish Church Hall, 55 Boswall Parkway (corner of Wardieburn Drive)\nEDINBURGH, EH5 2DA", "start_time": "2018-03-10T13:00:00+0000", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/25395833_10156149469848814_8565396382528773044_n.jpg?oh=bea08e25a17acd8b69611876149df77b&oe=5B0B18B2", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 56, "id": "10156149469848814"}, "noreply_count": 91, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T08:55:20+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTQ3MzEwNzAxOTM4MTQZD", "before": "MTAxNTQ3MzEwNzAxOTM4MTQZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "10154731070193814", "name": "Juliana Brustik-Dance"}]}, "maybe_count": 20, "place": {"id": "1656174357969943", "name": "Granton Parish Church", "location": {"latitude": 55.9760558, "city": "Edinburgh", "street": "55 Boswall Parkway", "longitude": -3.2240406, "country": "United Kingdom"}}, "end_time": "2018-03-11T17:00:00+0000", "owner": {"name": "Juliana Brustik-Dance", "id": "10154731070193814"}, "timezone": "Europe/London", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "2022003514712127", "name": "Oriental Egyptian Dance weekend"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/25395833_10156149469848814_8565396382528773044_n.jpg?oh=8efc7bdc3377e17a60f6980c89c9d5d7&oe=5B089208", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10156149469848814": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/25395833_10156149469848814_8565396382528773044_n.jpg?oh=bea08e25a17acd8b69611876149df77b&oe=5B0B18B2", "width": 640, "height": 427}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/25395833_10156149469848814_8565396382528773044_n.jpg?oh=0eb9c5a6b1d3b1f5914a5ce56fa303df&oe=5B123B05", "width": 479, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/25395833_10156149469848814_8565396382528773044_n.jpg?oh=7bf3c168a636ea138eaa2ae4054674b7&oe=5B1C4F15", "width": 194, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/25395833_10156149469848814_8565396382528773044_n.jpg?oh=17c3d7cf452bfbad87a20afb981b347d&oe=5B1192A3", "width": 337, "height": 225}], "width": 640, "id": "10156149469848814", "height": 427}}, "empty": null}
