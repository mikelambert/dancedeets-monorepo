He not only listens to how his sounds thread in and out of each other, but also focuses on how they are affected by the space in which they resonate. Rather than creating music, Osburn focuses on creating a sound environment in which to immerse his audience. Sourcing from his eclectic background in Western music, African drumming, and Sonic Arts studies, Osburn creates a unique musical blend which floods out of his speakers in an evocative array of frequencies.", "start_time": "2018-02-27T19:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26047013_10100537292523313_8551429605443009099_n.jpg?oh=7c0a5e2b8a262ef0ae9673a7b6a15292&oe=5B261B92", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 55, "id": "10100537292523313"}, "noreply_count": 271, "updated_time": "2018-02-08T16:06:10+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OTQ5NzM5MDAzMzAz", "before": "MTAxMDE0OTM4MzI2MjA3NzQZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "10101493832620774", "name": "Aubrey Griffith-Zill"}, {"id": "949739003303", "name": "Toni Craige"}]}, "maybe_count": 21, "place": {"id": "194201030943738", "name": "Living Arts Collective", "location": {"city": "Durham", "zip": "27701", "country": "United States", "longitude": -78.90069, "state": "NC", "street": "410 W Geer Street", "latitude": 36.00399}}, "end_time": "2018-02-27T21:30:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Toni Craige", "id": "949739003303"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "154344305198280", "name": "Tuesday CI Jam at LAC!
