It is an improvised dance that works through the connection with your partner and the music. It is not an easy dance to learn, but our 12-week series of classes are designed to prepare you for the social dance floor\u2014to connect and be able to enjoyably dance with another person! \n\nDuring classes you will learn a foundation of steps such as walking, basic turns, and close embrace, and you will be able to expand your dancing vocabulary as you are ready. All of our classes, from Beginner to Level 2 can be repeated. Many of us continue taking beginner classes even after we have completed the series. Topics for Level 1 and Level 2 classes are continually changing so we encourage all dancers to keep attending classes (your dance partners will thank you)!\n\nEvent for:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yaletangoclub/", "start_time": "2018-02-14T19:30:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=1634d45c420be901e47073cb411f17be&oe=5B25DB7B", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "10210552745430706"}, "noreply_count": 287, "updated_time": "2018-02-08T01:31:19+0000", "parent_group": {"id": "2200318884", "name": "Yale Tango Club", "privacy": "OPEN"}, "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTUxNDU2NDExMDk2OTQZD", "before": "MTAyMTE4NzI2NjM3MDg0MzUZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "10211872663708435", "name": "Caroline Alyse"}, {"id": "10208917354546956", "name": "James McDougal"}, {"id": "10214137882656826", "name": "Greg Selby Gibson"}, {"id": "10155145641109694", "name": "Karina Vargas Barria"}]}, "maybe_count": 78, "place": {"name": "80 Wall St, New Haven, CT"}, "end_time": "2018-02-14T22:30:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "James McDougal", "id": "10208917354546956"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "519581475043484", "name": "Argentine Tango at Yale - Wed Classes"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=6b517618e0cc5a42e0878b02cd97d1f6&oe=5B0FCE34", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10210552745430706": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=b58c0f5916b8c094d0457c803ff6556c&oe=5B088C8E", "width": 960, "height": 640}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=060a80c0086d1771feca38d32b0f9a54&oe=5B189E41", "width": 900, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=1634d45c420be901e47073cb411f17be&oe=5B25DB7B", "width": 720, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=4dcb155e4b15322f63173694738f42ea&oe=5B19BB39", "width": 480, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=39d51f1aa8eb6288eca812193a7bcb47&oe=5B0CB51C", "width": 810, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=4adddfdd2c05a9b0792b59919359e1c4&oe=5B08F829", "width": 195, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/22406494_10210552745430706_7665656574447448883_n.jpg?oh=0b144b2b9025b0eb336c933a78ee847a&oe=5B09479F", "width": 337, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "10210552745430706", "height": 480}}, "empty": null}
