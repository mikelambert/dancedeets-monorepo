No need to book, no need to bring a partner, just turn up! \n\nCEROC is sweeping dance floors across the nation! \nHere at Barton Hall in Horndean Tech College we get up to 150 people dancing CEROC Modern Jive every Thursday night.\n\nWe're running this FREE Beginners Taster Day for you to come along, try it and see how easy it is. You're GUARANTEED to be dancing a great routine through to music by the end of the day.\n==============================\n\nCEROC IS THE REAL SOCIAL NETWORK! \nEveryone changes partners in our classes so there\u2019s no need to come with a partner. It\u2019s a quick and easy way to meet lots of great people. \nEveryone asks everyone else to dance at Ceroc so you never need to feel you haven\u2019t got anyone to dance with - just get stuck in! \n\nI CAN'T/ WON'T DANCE! \nHad enough of clubs and discos but love to dance even though you have two left feet? Then CEROC is for you. There\u2019s no complicated footwork and you\u2019re GUARANTEED to be dancing a routine through to music on your very first session!\n\n============================\n\nWe'll have a full team on hand of experienced helpers moving around in the classes as well. \nThe classes are taught by fully qualified and insured teahcers.\n\nThe focus at a CEROC night is as much about the social element as it is learning to dance so you'll not only find our teachers to be professional, but fun, engaging and with a cheeky sense of humour too.\n============================\n\nThe music at CEROC is a mix of everything from classic old dance floor fillers like Michael Jackson and Van Morrisson through to current day chart toppers like Pink, Charlie Puth and Ofenbach. You'll hear a mix of Pop, Latin, Swing, Disco, Soul and more. Our DJ really knows how to create a great atmosphere!\n===========================\n\nAt CEROC it doesn't matter if you can't come every week (although why wouldn't you - it's the best fun you can have midweek with your clothes on!) as you can easily pick up from where you left off. \n\nThere's 12 Beginners moves in total and we teach 3 each week. On this Beginners Taster Day you'll be learning 2 routines so will have covered half of the Beginners syllabus in a flash! \n===========================\n\n* No need to book * No need for a partner * Complete Beginners welcome * Just turn up! * Tell all your friends & colleagues and get them along too!!\n\n* Also a brilliant way to get back to dancing if you haven't done it for a while & for our existing beginners to get in some sneaky extra free practice. \n\n* All members and non-members welcome along - the more the merrier!\n============================\n\nPerfect for:\n~ Anyone brand new to dancing\n~ Exisitng Beginners to help you fast-track\n~ Those who haven't danced for a while and would like to get back to it\n~ Anyone wanting a recap\n~ Experienced dancers who'd like an afternoon out helping others learn to dance\n\nKnow people who you think may be interested in coming along too?
