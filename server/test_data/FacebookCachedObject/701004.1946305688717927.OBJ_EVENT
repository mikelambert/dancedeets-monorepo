At early age Nada began her intensive training and performance with the prestigious Reda Troupe School (Egypt\u2019s first and most famous folkloric dance company) as well as many of the Egyptian masters and soloists with the Reda Troupe. Nada toured across Egypt performing in over one hundred performances, and over the course of her professional career in Egypt,  danced numerous times for several Middle Eastern Royal Families, and members of the Egyptian government during \u201c6th of October\u201d ceremonies. Nada also performed several times on National Egyptian television.\n\nNada is highly sought after as an instructor and performer. Her foremost goal as a teacher of Egyptian Dance is to take her students beyond mechanical technique and to nurture their development into culturally fluent, artistically fluid dancers.\n\nAs an artistic director, performer and teacher, Nada employs her unique in-depth insider\u2019s perspective to enrich the hearts and minds of her students and her audiences with an accurate understanding of the rich cultural and historical traditions of her country of origin, Egypt.\n\nNada El Masriya is the Artistic Director of The Egyptian Dance Academy  in Toronto, Canada\u2019s premier source for Egyptian Belly Dance and Folklore. \n\nFor more information, visit: www.blackcat-bellydance.com", "start_time": "2018-04-07T10:00:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/23561509_10115494255928804_5950240572092639442_n.jpg?oh=59a0e3c8c11cce5e17bb46461846222b&oe=5B0A887E", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0, "id": "10115494255928804"}, "noreply_count": 49, "updated_time": "2018-02-17T13:22:42+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxMDgyNDEzMjA4MjM4OTQZD", "before": "MTAyMDEwNDQwNDAxNjI5ODUZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "10201044040162985", "name": "Jacinda Li"}, {"id": "10108241320823894", "name": "Shannon Bishop"}]}, "maybe_count": 93, "place": {"id": "109265062433896", "name": "State College, PA", "location": {"city": "State College", "zip": "16801, 16803, 16804, 16805", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.8587, "state": "PA", "latitude": 40.7913}}, "end_time": "2018-04-08T15:00:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "Shannon Bishop", "id": "10108241320823894"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1946305688717927", "name": "Egyptian Dance Workshops with Nada El Masraya - April 7-8, 2018"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c165.0.200.200/p200x200/23561509_10115494255928804_5950240572092639442_n.jpg?oh=36603196f7766b3918d5456275d9f4f2&oe=5B162B4A", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10115494255928804": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/23561509_10115494255928804_5950240572092639442_n.jpg?oh=29c68c5d62f89e0f6c7a37455edbaa0d&oe=5B182995", "width": 851, "height": 315}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/23561509_10115494255928804_5950240572092639442_n.jpg?oh=36ee5d44de9b6c3e4ee19ec517b32c11&oe=5B21F532", "width": 351, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/23561509_10115494255928804_5950240572092639442_n.jpg?oh=09ae6d4f5458c519587ba7934bcb8a8c&oe=5B1D2984", "width": 607, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "10115494255928804", "height": 266}}, "empty": null}
