This course is so incredibly rewarding for us as teachers and for the entire team. \n\nOur dancers have made us so ridiculously proud 2 years running now from the effort they have invested into this course and from the wonderful performances they all gave.  \n\nWill be running our \"Performance Team\" which we have now named our \"DANCE COMPANY\" as it is not like any normal performance team around.  The spectacular results have gotten us a lot of attention and commercially our performances have been requested which is just fantastic. \n\nWe will be running this course from March Until November and will break in Dec so it will only be running for 9 Months. During that time you will learn a New Choreography and if you are a new member and wish to learn our current choreography following class you may. 9-9.30pm Thursdays\n\nEach year we have a strong theme and this year is no different. You will find out all in the first week. \n\nIs this course an effort? HELL YES\nIs it worth it? ABSOLUTELY \nIs it for the faint hearted? NO \nIs it for committed and loyal people? YES\nIs it fun? HELL YEAH \nCan I do the Class and not do any performances? We prefer you have some desire to perform and help your team mates on the stage. \nDo I need to also do any other Zouk Class? YES, ADVANCED ZOUK IS ESSENTIAL \nWhat sort of person do I need to be? ANY \n\nCostume cost is $150 per person (Excludes Make Up, Stockings and Shoes)\n\nThere will sometimes be extra Sunday Rehearsals but no longer than 3 hours. $10 cash to cover studio hire. \n\nCongresses and Comps we are attending: \n\n1. Salsa Solo (Nov) \n2. Zouk Weekender (Nov) \n3. Casa do Zouk (July) \n\nThe current team would also like to support \n\n1. Sunshine Coast Latin Festival \n2. GC Latin Dance Cup \n\nTo become part of this course please email us to book. \n\ninfo@conxsion.com\n\nAll payments will be via Direct Debit", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-04-26T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474345941688", "end_time": "2018-04-26T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-04-19T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474332608356", "end_time": "2018-04-19T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-04-12T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474325941690", "end_time": "2018-04-12T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-04-05T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474329275023", "end_time": "2018-04-05T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-29T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474335941689", "end_time": "2018-03-29T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-22T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474322608357", "end_time": "2018-03-22T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-15T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474339275022", "end_time": "2018-03-15T21:00:00+1000"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-08T20:00:00+1000", "id": "975474342608355", "end_time": "2018-03-08T21:00:00+1000"}], "start_time": "2018-03-08T20:00:00+1000", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/27751454_543112112717525_7863374719224925667_n.jpg?oh=3ce728d56574894c4781fafd6168a677&oe=5B1A7932", "offset_x": 3067, "offset_y": 0, "id": "543112112717525"}, "noreply_count": 151, "updated_time": "2018-02-07T16:57:31+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTI4MjUxNjI4ODQ5MDU4NgZDZD", "before": "MTE4OTMwMDM1MTM1NzM3"}}, "data": [{"id": "118930035135737", "name": "ConXsion Dance Studio"}, {"id": "1282516288490586", "name": "Sandro Santos"}]}, "maybe_count": 18, "place": {"name": "22 Karen Ave, Mermaid Beach QLD 4218, Australia"}, "end_time": "2018-04-26T21:00:00+1000", "owner": {"name": "ConXsion Dance Studio", "id": "118930035135737"}, "timezone": "Australia/Brisbane", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "975474319275024", "name": "Brazilian Zouk Choreography Course"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c227.0.200.200/p200x200/27751454_543112112717525_7863374719224925667_n.jpg?oh=a29625d27d0878c1325592e1bd2786e9&oe=5B0E8C53", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"543112112717525": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27751454_543112112717525_7863374719224925667_n.jpg?oh=9445a8df473de2734e9afddba957520a&oe=5B0E2550", "width": 784, "height": 295}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27751454_543112112717525_7863374719224925667_n.jpg?oh=67f8a1b909b9eef5a5ba247bfca73b8b&oe=5B1DCADE", "width": 345, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27751454_543112112717525_7863374719224925667_n.jpg?oh=4491975b2407031d346e1f52f15c891d&oe=5B04DAAA", "width": 597, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "543112112717525", "height": 270}}, "empty": null}
