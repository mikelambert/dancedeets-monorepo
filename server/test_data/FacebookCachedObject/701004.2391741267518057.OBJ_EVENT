Capoeira matches act as a colourful form of cultural expression in addition to a powerful form of self-defence. \nIn our Beginner Intro Course, instructors teach the basic martial arts and dance moves, as well as musical elements and basic acrobatics. Everything you need to get moving into a more advanced level... or just enough to follow along in the class, you will get in the Intro. How far you go is completely up to you. You can progress to the intermediate/advanced classes or just follow along for the workout and great energy you'll feel. \n\nTues/Thurs 7-8pm\nFirst 20 people get 33% OFF! Only $99 for 4 weeks (reg $149) - 8 Classes - Limited space available.\n\nAfter some months of training, students begin in the more tricky motions and the holistic knowledge necessary to advance in Capoeira's belt system, such as how to predict gravity's current strength before executing a backflip, timing and distance for attacks and how to escape from one's attack. Whether you choose to continue and progress through the belt system, or train for fitness, one thing is for sure: Capoeira is a whole-body workout that strengthens your core muscles, improves flexibility and LIVENS up your day. The classes also engage student's creative instincts as they sing, dance, and learn to play instruments.\n\n\nTestimonials:\n\"Ax\u00e9 has been a great environment from day 1! One of the best decisions I've made. Always challenging us and learning something new. True masters of movement! Would recommend to anyone looking to improve their overall health, I've never been more flexible and mobile :)\" - Adam P.\n\n\"Ax\u00e9 Capoeira Toronto is an excellent place to train and practice Capoeira. All the Capoeira teachers are brilliant, multi-talented and very inspiring. As a beginner to Capoeira I was welcomed with open arms, with great instruction on learning all the key movements and techniques of Capoeira. The Ax\u00e9 Capoeira Toronto academy is like a playground because as an adult you get the wonderful opportunity to allow your inner child to play again, make new friends and establish lifelong relationships with all the teachers and students. Ax\u00e9 Capoeira Toronto opens up the many different aspects of the Brazilian culture and way of life. Learning a martial art does so much for your body, mind and spirit connection. The Capoeira musical instruments are so cool to play and by singing you also acquire a whole new language! You will love it! - MKaur B.", "event_times": [{"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-02-20T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741300851387", "end_time": "2018-02-20T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-02-15T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741277518056", "end_time": "2018-02-15T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-02-13T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741280851389", "end_time": "2018-02-13T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-02-08T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741284184722", "end_time": "2018-02-08T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-02-06T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741297518054", "end_time": "2018-02-06T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-02-01T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741287518055", "end_time": "2018-02-01T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-01-30T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741294184721", "end_time": "2018-01-30T20:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "start_time": "2018-01-25T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2391741290851388", "end_time": "2018-01-25T20:00:00-0500"}], "start_time": "2018-01-25T19:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26172726_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_o.jpg?oh=35db78370283bb2eca78e1f7ec4e2043&oe=5AE1C590", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "10159891716090338"}, "noreply_count": 308, "updated_time": "2018-01-02T15:09:48+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTU1MDIwMzEyMDMZD", "before": "MTU1MDIwMzEyMDMZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "15502031203", "name": "Ax\u00e9 Capoeira Toronto"}]}, "maybe_count": 67, "place": {"id": "15502031203", "name": "Ax\u00e9 Capoeira Toronto", "location": {"city": "Toronto", "zip": "M6E 1A6", "country": "Canada", "longitude": -79.43926, "state": "ON", "street": "1069 St. Clair Ave West, 2nd Floor", "latitude": 43.6785}}, "end_time": "2018-02-20T20:00:00-0500", "ticket_uri": "http://www.axecapoeira-to.com/classes/capoeira-intro.php", "owner": {"name": "Ax\u00e9 Capoeira Toronto", "id": "15502031203"}, "timezone": "America/Toronto", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "2391741267518057", "name": "Beginner Intro Course"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c91.0.200.200/p200x200/26166227_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_n.jpg?oh=779421b99bb3e04a5195a1346ff2a3ba&oe=5B1663B4", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10159891716090338": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26172726_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_o.jpg?oh=8a9abaf8677075c456d264d08ecac76a&oe=5B14BC42", "width": 1200, "height": 628}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/26172726_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_o.jpg?oh=ea8d774a4ae66a16b85e419ebbff4a76&oe=5B1BEA68", "width": 1146, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/26172726_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_o.jpg?oh=8773f8b05004b8c8d0ae7f0c9689bce1&oe=5B25D352", "width": 917, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26166227_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_n.jpg?oh=284b2124849bacdf975793e31903fc1d&oe=5AE0C785", "width": 611, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/26172726_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_o.jpg?oh=6438170e2fa5ef6641f7ed83a8600d4b&oe=5ADD1D35", "width": 1031, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26166227_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_n.jpg?oh=fd31252f114db04abaf50304b7eebdfd&oe=5ADF7995", "width": 248, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26166227_10159891716090338_5148896898883715304_n.jpg?oh=0fa335e0a4c71372669abe8acc1131d8&oe=5B13A523", "width": 430, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "10159891716090338", "height": 376}}, "empty": null}
