Drop-in always welcome!!\u2728\n\nBrazilian Zouk is a beautiful, sensual partner dance that anyone can learn and that will help you improve your social dance skills. Anyone who dances it will tell you, that it is much more than a dance, it is a way of relaxing, meeting new people, making friends, and discovering yourself. When you join Zouk classes, you become a part of the Zouk family, and you are most welcome!\n\nThe classes are every TUESDAY at R\u00e5dmandsgades Skole, Tumlesalen K52 (in the basement), in the heart of N\u00f8rrebro.\n\nHere are directions to enter: \nhttp://www.zonendans.dk/en/lokale-2\n\nTUESDAYS:\n\u2022 18:00-20:00 Zouk Bolsistas\n\u2022 20:00-21:00 Zouk Level 1\n\u2022 21:00-22:00 Zouk Level 2 \n\n\ud83d\udd05 ZOUK LEVEL 1 \ud83d\udd05\nThis is where you get strong basics.

You will learn more advanced ways to connect the basics, and be introduced to more intricate musicality and learn how to be creative in your dance. You will also be introduced to some differences within the styles of Zouk and to differentiate them (Traditional/Rio style, Lambazouk, Neozouk, Flow Zouk, RnBzouk, Soulzouk, etc.) in relation to the music.\n\nStudents of Level 2 must continue taking Level 1 classes to continue improving their basics. Students can continue on Level 2 for 1-2 years before moving on to the next level.\nSign up with or without a partner!\n\nBOLSISTAS\nIn Brazil, the dance schools use a Bolsista system to raise the level of the dance, and we have adapted this system in our school.

It has only been in Europe now for about 20 years, and it is constantly growing and evolving. Traditionally, it was danced to Zouk music from the Caribbean, but now it can be danced to a variety of music, including R&B, pop, hip hop, and Kizomba, which makes it very versatile. Brazilian Zouk is known for its flowing, expressive and sensual movements. It is a dance with focus on trust and connection between the dancers, which can be tactile (connecting through touch), visual (connecting by looking at one another) or both at the same time. Both closed and open embrace are used in the dance, and sometimes the dancers also dance without physical connection.\n\nVIEW VIDEOS: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvgZTzG6bYfrxEJQKqgR_tYZBkGVKcfs\n\nYOUR TEACHERS\nCaroline (DK) has many years of experience in dance, but her favorite dance is Brazilian Zouk.
