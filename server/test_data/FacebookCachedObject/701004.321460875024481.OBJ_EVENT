Ask anyone who has been to AWCSO, \"what makes this event so special?\" and they will tell you it's the VIBE!! It's something that envelops every facet of the event and lifts the entire experience up to the next level. \n\n\nMany events have a world-class lineup of Champion and All-star dancers. \n\nBut our event directors and staff go ABOVE AND BEYOND to ensure that all of you have a great time! Everyone is present, socializing and dancing! \n\n \nMany events have workshops taught by great pros. \n\nBut our event is the only level-ed (by audition) workshop event in the region where you are guaranteed to be in workshops where the material challenges you, but yet you can cope. \n\n\nMany events have WSDC competitions. \n\nBut competing at AWCSO is not the same as competing elsewhere. Our crowd is genuinely supportive of everyone, and you will find true JOY competing here! \n\n\nMany events have late night dancing. \n\nBut our event is so fun, that on Saturday night at 5am, over 50% of all participants in the ballroom dancing. Where at 6am and it's time to close, the PRO STAFF are the ones leading the participants to ask for ANOTHER HOUR of social dancing! \n\n\nImportant Schedule Notes: \nTry to come in by Thursday! \n\nThursday morning-afternoon: The not to be missed Chuck's 'Live Like a Local Tour'. \nThursday evening: Pre-party like no other (60-70% of participants will be there) \n\nAs for going home, there isn't really a dance party on Sunday, but we have a chill out socialize and drink after-party with some light dancing for you all to unwind and enjoy this amazing community! \n\n\nCheck out www.asiawcsopen.com for details!\n\n\nPS.
