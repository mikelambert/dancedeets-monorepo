The short story is that is a very awesome partner dance from Brazil that will teach you the fundamentals of leading and following, so you can use the techniques in any style of dance! \n\n\nA little about Zouk Mia's curriculum:\nLevels 1 through 4 are six week progressive classes. Every week is a building block to the next lesson. All students, no matter what their level of dance, must start from level 1. All classes are 6 week progressive courses. *No drop in students allowed except for *Wednesday, *Friday 9PM, and our Saturday Monthly Bootcamp which will be announced on the events page. No partner necessary. In order to move on to the next level your Instructor must evaluate you at the end of each course and decide whether you are ready to move to the next level or repeat the same level again. Most students at some point in the their training will most likely be asked to repeat a level. We encourage our students to look at this as a good thing. Our culture promotes repetition and constant study of technique. It is our hope that students feel confident in the curriculum before moving on to the next level. If a student misses a class, it is up to them to make up the material before the following week. We highly recommend taking a private lesson in order to catch up before returning to the course.", "ticket_uri": "http://zoukmia.com/class.html", "start_time": "2018-02-17T10:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26756995_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_o.jpg?oh=c20d08e077d40977d038901559ae3188&oe=5B1E58C7", "offset_x": 50, "offset_y": 0, "id": "1559487837469602"}, "noreply_count": 99, "updated_time": "2018-01-15T21:50:14+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MzcwMDI5OTI5NzQ4NzM4", "before": "MTM3Nzg5ODYwNTc3NDM1MgZDZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "1377898605774352", "name": "Kendy"}, {"id": "903605253035735", "name": "Zouk Mia - Orlando"}, {"id": "370029929748738", "name": "Zouk Mia"}]}, "maybe_count": 18, "place": {"id": "651738921668493", "name": "UV Latin Dance Academy", "location": {"city": "North Miami Beach", "zip": "33162", "country": "United States", "longitude": -80.15658, "state": "FL", "street": "2159 NE 163 St.", "latitude": 25.9263}}, "end_time": "2018-02-17T17:00:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Zouk Mia", "id": "370029929748738"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "877003595815459", "name": "Brazilian Zouk Fastrack Intensive w/ ZoukMia [Levels 1-3]"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q87/c208.0.200.200/p200x200/26903678_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_n.jpg?oh=75000670e3133bc6e6683bf8410a1730&oe=5AD8E0E7", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1559487837469602": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26756995_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_o.jpg?oh=547b4ba87004e22556328e91a9ba6070&oe=5B26E7DB", "width": 1582, "height": 513}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/26756995_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_o.jpg?oh=45ba93b65ff4b82a832d2995cbcc1566&oe=5B1483D2", "width": 1480, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q87/p320x320/26756995_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_o.jpg?oh=3e69b2988901c74007736818e5614017&oe=5B076A34", "width": 986, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q87/p130x130/26903678_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_n.jpg?oh=2f4130bd31b573094371acdfd759d458&oe=5B172671", "width": 401, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/q87/p75x225/26756995_1559487837469602_4793874902851807470_o.jpg?oh=16da84fda87b3ded80dd323c009069fe&oe=5B26E225", "width": 693, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1559487837469602", "height": 233}}, "empty": null}
