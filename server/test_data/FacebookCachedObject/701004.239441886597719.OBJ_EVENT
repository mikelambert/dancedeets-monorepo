This is not your traditional country line dancing because we play a wide variety of music including good country music.  \n\nNew dances as well as current favorites and classics are taught by our instructors.  If you've ever wanted to learn to dance but were too shy or felt uncoordinated, this is a great introduction to dancing as a solo because you learn the steps as an individual. Every step you learn in our classes can and WILL be seen on the dance floors of parties and clubs. \n\nThe doors open at 7 PM.  Beginners start at 7:15 PM for some Absolute Beginner and Beginner steps and lessons.  Our regular class will start at 8 PM followed by open dancing until close.  Come experience a fun workout, line dance and meet new people every Friday night.\n\nFor more information, please check out our website at:\n\nwww.waxhawlinedancers.com\n\n...and 'LIKE' us on Facebook.", "start_time": "2018-02-16T19:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/27657441_1548030345307099_362262394197029324_n.jpg?oh=a4365a27ed021dbc9d1cf36bc12b2a66&oe=5B26096C", "offset_x": 67, "offset_y": 0, "id": "1548030345307099"}, "noreply_count": 12, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T04:14:47+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MzUxOTY2Mjc4MjQ2ODUx", "before": "MzUxOTY2Mjc4MjQ2ODUx"}}, "data": [{"id": "351966278246851", "name": "Waxhaw Line Dancers"}]}, "maybe_count": 11, "place": {"id": "351966278246851", "name": "Waxhaw Line Dancers", "location": {"city": "Waxhaw", "zip": "28173", "country": "United States", "longitude": -80.73608, "state": "NC", "street": "801 E South Main St", "latitude": 34.92312}}, "end_time": "2018-02-16T22:00:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Waxhaw Line Dancers", "id": "351966278246851"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "239441886597719", "name": "Line Dance Lessons to Country and Non-Country"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c166.0.200.200/p200x200/27657441_1548030345307099_362262394197029324_n.jpg?oh=668f37917288cb4627eec01e2bd0b4ca&oe=5AD8BD25", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1548030345307099": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27657441_1548030345307099_362262394197029324_n.jpg?oh=a5dadb866beab11038bf0ae4262579d3&oe=5ADA430E", "width": 784, "height": 295}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27657441_1548030345307099_362262394197029324_n.jpg?oh=2114fdbf4fadeefebf3346c552bbecd7&oe=5B1F8780", "width": 345, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27657441_1548030345307099_362262394197029324_n.jpg?oh=a0c2e4fb9c0152eb81edec69527840c2&oe=5B1808F4", "width": 597, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1548030345307099", "height": 270}}, "empty": null}
