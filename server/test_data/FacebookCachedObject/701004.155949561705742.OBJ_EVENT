I imagine that you may be seeking the same. Years ago, while dancing to Lift Ticket\u2019s music at Contra Dancers Delight Holiday, an important shift on this journey took place. I noticed what a joyful affect a fellow dancer  had on others throughout the dance formations. It wasn\u2019t necessarily what he said, though that was important. His intentional presence was obvious, making a pleasure to dance with. In taking with him after the dance I learned he practice Nonviolent Communication. Ever since then my own \"NVC\" practice has become a game changer across all areas of my life. It is a tool which offers me opportunities to become more compassionate, whole hearted, and less violent both internally and externally. My practice shifts how I run my house, choose my diet, maintain relationships, and even write my clinical notes. Adopting \"Nonviolent Communication\", a compassionate communication format changes the way I physically move through space and time. True Colors CC Dance Retreat is a way to share my experience as a therapist, dancer, and chef by providing the opportunity for others to explore the benefits of \"NVC\". Many thanks to fellow practitioners and True Colors Retreat collaborators: Lift Ticket musicians Rex Blazer, TJ Crow, and Jeff Spero; Callers Terry Doyle, Warren Doyle; Sound John Petalion, Workshop leaders John Brady and Willow Kelly and Crew of True Color Cooking.\n\nWith gratitude, we invite you to join us for a joyful weekend of dance, dining, and community. Harriette\n\nWhat Is \"Nonviolent Communication\" (NVC) aka Compassionate Communication?\n\nA communication process developed by Marshall Rosenberg beginning in the 1960\u2019s, \"NVC\" is a technique for clear, empathic, nonjudgmental communications proceeding through four areas of focus: observation, feelings, needs and request.  \n\nWhile \"NVC\" is taught as a process of communication to improve compassionate connections to others, it has also been interpreted as a spiritual practice, a set of values, a parenting technique, an education method and a worldview. \u201c\u2026 an easy to grasp, effective method to get at the roots of violence and pain peacefully. By examining the unmet needs behind what we do and say, NVC helps reduce hostility, heal pain, and strengthen professional and personal relationships. \u201d  \u2013 Marshall Rosenberg\n\nWhy is \"Nonviolent Communication\" Relevant to Contra Dancing?\nCC/NVC provides a set of skills to request and receive something we need while dancing and ways to consider meeting the expressed needs of others. It keeps the dance community \u2018s \u201cplay space\u201d safe and satisfying. The practice allows us to increase our capacity for compassion and then share this through whole hearted dancing. Rather than exact moves making the difference in a dance, the value lies in the spaces between them. \n\nNot Your Typical Dance Weekend: \n\nTrue Color CC Retreat is designed to experience \"NVC\" basics betwixt and between a weekend filled with dancing and dining. With authenticity and mutual respect, we will learn about the ways we communicate (both verbally and non) and consider strategies to live with more compassion, grace, and connection. Subsequently, we will benefit as individuals and positively effect those in in our circles beyond the weekend. \n\nWho Creates This Experience?
