Each week, we\u2019ll start with a yoga warm-up, and then we will cover the different types of belly dance movements in detail: undulations, shimmies, serpentine arms, spins and more. Each class will build upon the previous one, but drop-ins are always welcome! Come learn new moves and feel sexy in a supportive, body positive environment.\n\nI\u2019d like to especially invite the pregnant and postpartum mamas (and babies) to this dance class! Belly dance is a great way to work out during pregnancy. The movements of belly dance can help align the baby into ideal alignment for birth, and can also provide relief for the mama up to and even during labor. After pregnancy, belly dance movements can help re-align the spine and hips and tone the belly and reproductive organs.\n\n$15 drop in \n\nAbout Chrystalline:\nChrystalline has been dancing since she was child, and belly dancing since 2007. She has 3 kids that were all born at home, and she danced through each of her pregnancies. Belly dance and yoga were crucial to rehabilitating after giving birth. She enjoys teaching and performing around the country. Chrystalline dances while spinning fire, and also has a pet snake she adds to performances now and then. Her favorite thing about belly dance is the connection and community it builds amongst women.\n\nShe is also a massage therapist, Reiki Master-Teacher, certified yoga instructor, and owner/herbalist at Pentacle Apothecary.", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-02-27T19:00:00-0700", "id": "327290461113085", "end_time": "2018-02-27T20:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-20T19:00:00-0700", "id": "327290464446418", "end_time": "2018-02-20T20:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-13T18:00:00-0700", "id": "327290467779751", "end_time": "2018-02-13T19:30:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-06T18:00:00-0700", "id": "327290457779752", "end_time": "2018-02-06T19:30:00-0700"}], "start_time": "2018-02-06T18:00:00-0700", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=62a1a4ff3ac2a1c65bcab53dd2cccc51&oe=5B22005C", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 1, "id": "568518390153932"}, "noreply_count": 1, "updated_time": "2018-02-14T01:48:41+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTQ3NDQwNTM5ODAyNzYZD", "before": "NDA4MTgyNDU2MTg3NTI3"}}, "data": [{"id": "408182456187527", "name": "Moon + Womb"}, {"id": "10154744053980276", "name": "Chrystalline Marie"}]}, "maybe_count": 35, "place": {"id": "408182456187527", "name": "Moon + Womb", "location": {"city": "Lakewood", "zip": "80214", "country": "United States", "longitude": -105.07512, "state": "CO", "street": "1400 Saulsbury St. Unit C", "latitude": 39.73872}}, "end_time": "2018-02-27T20:00:00-0700", "owner": {"name": "Moon + Womb", "id": "408182456187527"}, "timezone": "America/Denver", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "327290434446421", "name": "Tribal Fusion Bellydance February Series"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.0.200.200/p200x200/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=f40a31bd3204a5eb625e4cf39e657429&oe=5B4DF6E8", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"568518390153932": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=62a1a4ff3ac2a1c65bcab53dd2cccc51&oe=5B22005C", "width": 425, "height": 672}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=7c26085eae65195507f2a60d878794ca&oe=5B10E7BD", "width": 320, "height": 505}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=9915449129db0c8163f78d6b190c49c8&oe=5B0B3700", "width": 341, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=2a5049506b7a5a01af7e936e0c39797c&oe=5B1599D2", "width": 130, "height": 205}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27331552_568518390153932_7433471310301751664_n.jpg?oh=307b1d0f77678682d09456978381c668&oe=5B09A3A6", "width": 142, "height": 225}], "width": 425, "id": "568518390153932", "height": 672}}, "empty": null}
