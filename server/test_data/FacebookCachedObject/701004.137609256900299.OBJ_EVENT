Everyone loves circles and figure eights, but what about squares, vees, and moon shapes?\n\nWe will also focus on smooth transitions between our isolations, staying mindful of how these movements flow through the body.\n\nThen we will utilize these concepts in a handful of Tribal Fusion style combinations that can be sprinkled into a choreography or simply used to change things up in your regular practice drills.  \n\nFor this workshop knowledge of basic bellydance movements is suggested.\n\n\nNicole has been dancing since she was a child and fell in love with bellydance while attending college.  She believes that even when life gets crazy, the ritual of dance practice can be used to stay active, grounded, and balanced.  In her spare time she enjoys going to music festivals, working on craft projects, and cooking vegan food.  She is grateful to be a part of the lively and inclusive Michigan bellydance community.\n\nVending: we will have a couple of vendors and a used item tabel. Bring your stuff One woman's junk is another Dancers treasure!\n\n$20 if paid by March 1st, $25 at the door pending availability.\nContact Kindred Sisters Dance Collective or Jennifer Price-Stamper for payment information, and don't forget to like our Facebook page!", "start_time": "2018-03-10T14:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=0d2ae2bb292f5ece417bca93fbc36be9&oe=5B4C30AB", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 24, "id": "2029023840653045"}, "noreply_count": 29, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T19:54:56+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTk2MDk1MTAzMDc5MzY2MAZDZD", "before": "MTk2MDk1MTAzMDc5MzY2MAZDZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "1960951030793660", "name": "Kindred Sisters Dance Collective"}]}, "maybe_count": 87, "place": {"id": "1332909800170285", "name": "Studio One-Eleven", "location": {"city": "Leslie", "zip": "49251", "country": "United States", "longitude": -84.43248, "state": "MI", "street": "111 Carney St.", "latitude": 42.44937}}, "end_time": "2018-03-10T16:00:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Kindred Sisters Dance Collective", "id": "1960951030793660"}, "timezone": "America/Detroit", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "137609256900299", "name": "Tribal Fusion Workshop with Nicole Ferguson"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.0.200.200/p200x200/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=8523064efb6a651e20065296356fd653&oe=5B10B927", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"2029023840653045": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=2ad95725756edca6f1a794e98eefcc77&oe=5B0E78D5", "width": 614, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=5e77175a4c938730ec78e16630461843&oe=5B4D86E7", "width": 600, "height": 938}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=a0c0b553bd047e84acf59a9d23d2ca2a&oe=5B0EABCE", "width": 480, "height": 750}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=6af67fbe95efa2471d8555db71f6a9e5&oe=5B017A89", "width": 320, "height": 500}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=e166f32952229da1f9cd0555bff65102&oe=5B0386C2", "width": 345, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=54bec124960cf48e435257ffac8278fc&oe=5B4DAC6E", "width": 130, "height": 203}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/24852544_2029023840653045_3839285195820835554_n.jpg?oh=623c2eed9f637ac68bbbc8bf175325ff&oe=5B066FD9", "width": 143, "height": 225}], "width": 460, "id": "2029023840653045", "height": 720}}, "empty": null}
