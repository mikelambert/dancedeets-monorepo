Space is LIMITED so please book and make your payment latest by Monday 26 Feb.\n\nSince my recent sacred journey to Egypt, I'm called to offer a meditation and activation session for friends in Penang who feel a strong connection to the Egyptian spiritual lineage or interested to form a connection with the sacred Field of Light covering major Chakra temples. Our mission was to re-activate the original Blueprint of Unity or Christ Consciousness in this sacred land of Khempt or Egypt as it was thousands of years ago, through energetic work at the various temples that held the chakra energies along the Nile!\n\nOur meditation on Friday 2 March coincides with the full moon and will help you make a deep soul connection to the sacred original Blueprint of the Field of Light in Egypt. You will also form energetic connections with one or more of the Egyptian deities, in particular Thoth, Mother Isis, Sekmet, Horus, Anubis and or Hathor. Each of these deities carry an energetic frequency that will support you in various aspects of healing and your life growth, transformation and mastery! \n\nSound work will help with the energetic release and activations. Some of you may receive healings and/or rememberance from your past lives in Egypt as well as renewed connections to bring forth \"gifts\" to your present life.\n\nSacred objects and scents from my recent sacred journey will help create the energetic environment needed for this meditation session. You will all receive something to take home with you to form a continued connection with the Egyptian sacred lineage.\n\nPlease bring along any crystals you would like to add to the session for activation as well. The following crystals related to the Egyptian tradition include: Turquoise, Lapis Lazuli, Citrin, Clear quartz, Apatite, Malachite, Tiger's Eye, Calcite, Carnelian, and Coral are possible stones you may want to have with you to strengthen your meditation and connection to the Egyptian Sacred Field of Light.\n\nI'm so looking forward to sharing much of what I've been SO BLESSED to receive!
