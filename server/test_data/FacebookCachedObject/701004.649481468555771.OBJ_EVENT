Yet, the beauty of \ufffdthis dance has not diminished with time. It has become even more exquisite as its intricacies have changed and adapted to modern music and concept.  Bellydance is a uniquely powerful and feminine form of dance.\n\nThe movements are natural to the female body, although, in the beginning it may not feel that way. The process of learning to bellydance strengthens the core, abs, legs, arms and shoulders while increasing heart rate and burning calories. It improves the body while teaching grace, femininity, and strength. Beginning a bellydance class can feel intimidating, but most people begin class with no dance experience. It takes about six weeks for the body to respond the way you may want, but it is worth the effort.\n\nWe will offer Egyptian style bellydance, that  is recognized by it\u2019s elegant and graceful movement coupled with intricate hip and torso isolation and perfectly placed accents. This style has been heavily influenced by the body placement and staging of European ballet and the intricate and orchestrated style of classical Egyptian music. It is the culmination of centuries of indigenous dance, orchestrated music and European influence. The result is elegant, fluid, and feminine movement that is exalted by the intricacies of classical Egyptian music.\n\nClasses offered by Laska Dance , Laska trained as a belly dancer primarily in New York and in Boston. She also spent three years studying Afro-Caribbean dance, and dabbled in Jazz, Modern, Flamenco, and Isadora Duncan dance. She has performed in festivals, private parties, street fairs, haflas, a hookah lounge, and in original productions by Elisheva, titled \"Into the Mystic\u201d and \u201cThe Dancer,\" in Hartford, Connecticut. She performed with her former ATS troupe, Lynchburg Tribal, for five years prior to moving to Connecticut.\nWe encourage pre registration. \nclick the tickets link for registration \n\nPrice is :$15 per class - or $80 for six classes\nSundays  5-6 pm\nfrom Jan 21- Feb 25 2018", "event_times": [{"ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "start_time": "2018-02-25T17:00:00-0500", "id": "649481491889102", "end_time": "2018-02-25T18:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "start_time": "2018-02-18T17:00:00-0500", "id": "649481475222437", "end_time": "2018-02-18T18:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "start_time": "2018-02-11T17:00:00-0500", "id": "649481478555770", "end_time": "2018-02-11T18:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "start_time": "2018-02-04T17:00:00-0500", "id": "649481481889103", "end_time": "2018-02-04T18:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "start_time": "2018-01-28T17:00:00-0500", "id": "649481485222436", "end_time": "2018-01-28T18:00:00-0500"}, {"ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "start_time": "2018-01-21T17:00:00-0500", "id": "649481488555769", "end_time": "2018-01-21T18:00:00-0500"}], "start_time": "2018-01-21T17:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=38b9e9a1bd0db0e89ba52718ae8a1b0b&oe=5B139711", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 20, "id": "660614004275026"}, "noreply_count": 40, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T23:36:22+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTY0OTU4Njc2NTM0MzczNQZDZD", "before": "MTkyNjcxMjcxMDY5MzA0"}}, "data": [{"id": "192671271069304", "name": "The  Garage dance studio and gallery"}, {"id": "1649586765343735", "name": "Laska Dance"}]}, "maybe_count": 174, "place": {"id": "192671271069304", "name": "The  Garage dance studio and gallery", "location": {"city": "New Britain", "zip": "06053", "country": "United States", "longitude": -72.759812997832, "state": "CT", "street": "1385 East St", "latitude": 41.690528163461}}, "end_time": "2018-02-25T18:00:00-0500", "ticket_uri": "https://squareup.com/store/Bellydance", "owner": {"name": "The  Garage dance studio and gallery", "id": "192671271069304"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "649481468555771", "name": "Egyptian Belly Dance classes - Beginners"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/26219105_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_n.jpg?oh=fb8cca51af3b8e818ca6f8fefb2e52a8&oe=5B1F890E", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"660614004275026": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=21b67d9ce32c30b7bd23af825e71fda9&oe=5B179F84", "width": 2048, "height": 1365}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p960x960/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=0873b4a9d199724a7624cf240d2a3469&oe=5B1AD7A3", "width": 1440, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=384fafdeb404b0d8e149e15431e85894&oe=5B087F02", "width": 1080, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=ac7353ac80fe967a7d133eed5b699be2&oe=5B0C1117", "width": 900, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=2cbd5e1a6b25b1c4331dcd4b69b4313a&oe=5B103BF7", "width": 720, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26219105_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_n.jpg?oh=2c2592df2a8ed90c3ccd703c0675cd71&oe=5B4DDD2D", "width": 480, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/26233512_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_o.jpg?oh=38c3556b3c965f6893b4a326aab445bd&oe=5B202110", "width": 810, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26219105_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_n.jpg?oh=57546e084600200f6f3ff5805cb0b88d&oe=5B16FF42", "width": 195, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26219105_660614004275026_8943358920434493670_n.jpg?oh=e58d546141478447ada23fe73a71d8da&oe=5B0BFF36", "width": 338, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "660614004275026", "height": 479}}, "empty": null}
