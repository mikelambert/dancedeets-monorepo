Its sound is influenced by Count Basie and Harry James and has covered the top swing venues throughout the Midwest. The band has been nominated for Detroit Music Awards including Best Big Band/Swing artists, Outstanding Jazz Vocalist and Outstanding Jazz Instrumentalists.\nDancers of all skill levels are welcome. Many come just to enjoy the sights and sounds. Dress is semi-formal or vintage attire. General admission begins at 6:30 p.m. with a dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. The band will hit the stage at 8:15 p.m. and perform until midnight. There is a cash bar available throughout the evening. Dress is snappy casual to semi-formal; or vintage attire.\n\nTickets are $25 per person in advance or at the door. Add $5 for the optional lesson. Tables of eight may be reserved in advance at no additional charge.\n\n**I am now accepting payment by PayPal and Venmo in addition to personal check.\n- Venmo - payable to swingdj74; email your guests' names to sean@djanddance.com.\n- PayPal - payable to sean@djanddance.com -- please choose, \"send money to friends and family\" to avoid processing fees.

The area is better lit and lots are better gated. The drawback is that parking will likely cost more than $10 per vehicle. I will not know in advance what the prices will be but the lots closer to LCA will be more expensive. This is the weekend of the NCAA tournament so get there early.\n\nThe BIG3s pull dancers and non-dancers from all ages together for incredible evenings of music and dance. If you don't know how to dance, come join the many that soak in the sights and sounds of an unforgettable evening. The previous BIG3s have brought more than 12,000 people together! Don't miss this one!\n\nDirections to the Masonic.\nPictures from recent BIG3 swing dances\n\n248.879.3706 or sean@djanddance.com for more details.", "start_time": "2018-03-24T19:00:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26198070_10155801933428819_1996153113066133594_o.jpg?oh=f25e07a3b3d998a1e326caabd7df1eaa&oe=5B12C6FE", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "10155801933428819"}, "noreply_count": 669, "updated_time": "2018-02-10T10:29:56+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTQ5NDc2Nzg1NTM4MTkZD", "before": "MTAxNTQ5NDc2Nzg1NTM4MTkZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "10154947678553819", "name": "Sean K.
