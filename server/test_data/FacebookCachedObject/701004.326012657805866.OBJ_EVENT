He started dancing ballroom at the age of 16, also participating in shows already in his first year. Later he discovered Latin dances such as Salsa, Bachata and others, before he got fascinated by Brazilian ZOUK, which now he has been dancing since 2010 and teaching since 2011. Since 2014 he also dances Samba de Gafieira, which he is also teaching as of 2016.\nGuido has learnt from all important Zouk/Gafieira teachers across the globe in Europe and Brazil in group and private classes as well as numerous special teacher trainings in group and private setting, partly in Brazil, where he was also already teaching. The teachers influencing his dance style most significantly are world-famous stars Freddy MARINHO & Andressa CASTELHANO, William TEIXEIRA & Paloma ALVES and Clinton LACERDA & Cristi BOONE. They are all teaching pure or slightly adapted \u201cZouk-Tradicional\u201d.\nA significant increase of the Zouk scene in Vienna happened thanks to Guido's initiative: Starting in 2011 he was the first one to teach weekly classes and to organize weekly socials in Austria as well as regular workshop weekends with famous guest teachers (predominantly from Brazil) in Vienna. He is founder of the yearly events RIO ZOUK (& SAMBA) WEEKEND and MEGA ZOUK & SAMBA WEEKEND and has organized numerous smaller events. Overall he has brought almost all big teachers to Vienna for workshops, festivals and also for longer-term stays.\nHe is the founder of ZOUK-VIENNA CONNECTION, the first association in Austria specifically dedicated to ZOUK and other Brazilian dances working closely with other Brazilian organizations.\nAs a former member of the International Zouk Flash Mob Management Team (IZFM MT) he also worked to serve the Zouk scene worldwide for several years. Recently he also started creating Zouk remixes as \"DJ Guido Zoukeiro\" and playing on various international events.", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-03-20T19:00:00+0100", "id": "339560979784367", "end_time": "2018-03-21T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-13T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747323999066", "end_time": "2018-03-14T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-06T19:00:00+0100", "id": "326012687805863", "end_time": "2018-03-07T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-27T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747300665735", "end_time": "2018-02-28T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-20T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747307332401", "end_time": "2018-02-21T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-13T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747310665734", "end_time": "2018-02-14T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-06T20:15:00+0100", "id": "330747303999068", "end_time": "2018-02-07T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-30T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747313999067", "end_time": "2018-01-31T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-23T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747317332400", "end_time": "2018-01-24T00:00:00+0100"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-16T19:00:00+0100", "id": "330747320665733", "end_time": "2018-01-17T00:00:00+0100"}], "start_time": "2018-01-16T19:00:00+0100", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=25cdf0b4255d5babf1ef620a0471c819&oe=5B164923", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1662795907121545"}, "noreply_count": 120, "updated_time": "2018-02-06T17:09:29+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mzg4MjQwNDA3OTEwNDQx", "before": "Mzg4MjQwNDA3OTEwNDQx"}}, "data": [{"id": "388240407910441", "name": "Zouk-Vienna"}]}, "maybe_count": 48, "place": {"id": "1374788542790899", "name": "Passion CLC", "location": {"city": "Vienna", "zip": "1170", "country": "Austria", "longitude": 16.34084, "street": "Hernalser Hauptstrasse 5", "latitude": 48.21645}}, "end_time": "2018-03-21T00:00:00+0100", "owner": {"name": "Zouk-Vienna", "id": "388240407910441"}, "timezone": "Europe/Vienna", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "326012657805866", "name": "Brazilian Zouk Beginner & Improver Courses // 2018"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c35.0.200.200/p200x200/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=d8d94c31baefa617e852bbc6a3e537e4&oe=5B1D2B52", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1662795907121545": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=0313f80c16e12f24b22d2195e89059d1&oe=5B08455D", "width": 851, "height": 630}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=33d5d501fac844c0dc5bc93c1e2cc00e&oe=5B05AD6F", "width": 810, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=409e5233dc1180ee1ac747832207c79e&oe=5B104746", "width": 648, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=4281ccc2a4e3ab563f962b92359a6d75&oe=5ADA5C01", "width": 432, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=555a079a23d9b512d7672bcbff13d1c3&oe=5B253E4A", "width": 729, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=105e329332a0152097757554aea5bef7&oe=5B065DE6", "width": 175, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26733427_1662795907121545_9030501818259279275_n.jpg?oh=2e10a72bced559ec37cfba653172d6b2&oe=5B05CB51", "width": 303, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1662795907121545", "height": 533}}, "empty": null}
