Relaxing their dancing and giving them more style, better technique and posture.\n\nAllowing you to dance to some of the more chilled and beautiful music that is becoming much more common.\n\nThis 8 week course will take you right from the beginning all the way through to Progressive level.\nOver the 8 week course you will learn the 12 Fundamental moves and the 12 Progressive moves. Giving you easily enough repetoire and technique to vastly enhance your dancing and boost you to a much higher level of ability and confidence.\n\nIf you have been dancing for some time and feel you are at a stand still?\nOr,  \nLooking for a new challenge?....... then this is for you. \n\nMEN- you will be leading beautiful and cool flowing moves\nLADIES -  you will have more control over your dancing and technique and feel much more involved in the dance.
