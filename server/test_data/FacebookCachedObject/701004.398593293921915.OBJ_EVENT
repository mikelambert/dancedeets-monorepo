It is strong, supple, sensual, and steeped in stories and history.  Combined with light and movement, silk invokes dramatic magic for the human senses.  Join Gaea Lady in exploring movement & dance with silk - learning specific movements, patterns, and techniques to integrate dancer and fabric together.  We'll explore dynamic whips, dreamy floats, weaves, infinite recursive spins, drapes, wraps, and improvisation to ignite the senses and the creativity within.   Students will dance with unweighted & weighted veils and flags- learning the basics of this specialty custom veil.\n\nStudents should bring a silk or light fabric veil, at least 4x8 feet.  Students can also bring large fabric costume pieces for improvisation in class.  Gaea will have a limited amount of veils available for use, borrow, and sale. \n\nFor custom orders in advance, contact gaealady@gmail.com \n\n$40 (Space Limited to 10 students)\nto register: paypal, venmo or chase quickpay/zelle to gaealady@gmail.com with your name and class date in the comments \n\nGaea will be headlining the Carnivale De Sensuale: Spring Equinox 2018 that night, so plan to come! \n\nabout gaea: \nGaea lady is an enchantress by nature, a force that will make you feel the very earth move.
