This album\u2019s newly written songs emanate from producer Larry Klein suggesting that they try organizing writing sessions with a group of great musicians/writers that include Patrick Warren, Brian Macleod, and David Baerwald. Along with the newly written songs figure two previously written songs featuring Madeleine in her distinctive style: the classic title track by Leonard Cohen, and the Harold Arlen/ E.Y. \u201cYip\u201d Harburg song \u201cLast Night When We Were Young.\u201d This album achieves the difficult task of balancing humor, pathos, and irony, while weaving a topical thread throughout, addressing the current state of the world. Absent are any traces of preachiness or angry diatribes, and in their place are songs written from a diverse group of perspectives and vantage points: a man and a woman in a mental ward / rehab discussing their predicament, a Generation X pot-smoking gamer, a recently single woman whose lover has vanished, and a down-on-her-luck tenant in an apartment building, whose door has just been kicked in by the landlord. From this varied cast of Raymond Carver-esque characters and more, a vivid picture is painted of the challenges that our times present for someone trying to hold on to their hope, heart, and optimism in the world that we now confront.", "ticket_uri": "https://bellyupsolanabeach.frontgatetickets.com/event/wd25yvfxvniconpr", "start_time": "2018-05-28T20:00:00-0700", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/23517675_10155160084652149_8432153418358050635_n.jpg?oh=a2a145bae3242a462a6fea82a3ee862f&oe=5B25AFBE", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 9, "id": "10155160084652149"}, "noreply_count": 1, "updated_time": "2018-01-24T23:51:18+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NjYxODY2NjIzNAZDZD", "before": "MTMwNjA5MjkzMDgz"}}, "data": [{"id": "130609293083", "name": "Madeleine Peyroux"}, {"id": "6618666234", "name": "Belly Up"}]}, "maybe_count": 88, "place": {"id": "6618666234", "name": "Belly Up", "location": {"city": "Solana Beach", "zip": "92075", "country": "United States", "longitude": -117.27035, "state": "CA", "street": "143 S Cedros Ave Ste T", "latitude": 32.98978}}, "end_time": "2018-05-28T23:00:00-0700", "owner": {"name": "Belly Up", "id": "6618666234"}, "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1792957450997359", "name": "Madeleine Peyroux: Live at the Belly Up"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/23517675_10155160084652149_8432153418358050635_n.jpg?oh=383335df3deb808beca1e1903c4e468d&oe=5B13EB04", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10155160084652149": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/23517675_10155160084652149_8432153418358050635_n.jpg?oh=a2a145bae3242a462a6fea82a3ee862f&oe=5B25AFBE", "width": 640, "height": 427}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/23517675_10155160084652149_8432153418358050635_n.jpg?oh=c8436010d25f1fba5a31f877f524a0df&oe=5B053909", "width": 479, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/23517675_10155160084652149_8432153418358050635_n.jpg?oh=18845bf09ba84def2aee4d7d9376e254&oe=5B067319", "width": 194, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/23517675_10155160084652149_8432153418358050635_n.jpg?oh=73301f5d28c0d00dbec1806c621d81ee&oe=5B054EAF", "width": 337, "height": 225}], "width": 640, "id": "10155160084652149", "height": 427}}, "empty": null}
