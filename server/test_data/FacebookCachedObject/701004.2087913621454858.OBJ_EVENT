If you're interested in helping and/or becoming a board member, please message us here! Here's something to look forward to in the meantime. We have a special event planned for this March at Bell's Brewery\u200b! Please join us and spread the word! The picture is from a previous dance at Bells with so many familiar shining faces. \n\nMonday, March 12, 2018\nSpecial Event at Bells Brewery!\nMusic TBA!\nCalls by Carol Ormand!\nPrice: $5, more if you can.\nLesson: 7:30 pm\nDance: 8 pm\n18+ early evening, 21+ after 9:00pm\n\nSquare Dance Kalamazoo website:\nwww.squaredancekalamazoo.com\n\nSQUARE DANCE KALAMAZOO 101\n\n\"Stomp n' shout, spin n' sing, \nSquare Dance Kalamazoo gives you wings!\"\n\nBEGINNER FRIENDLY!\nBeginner lessons at 7:30 to help with basic techniques. But, these moves are meant to be simple. Anyhow, sometimes messing up is half the fun.\n\nSINGLES FRIENDLY!\nYou can come alone, +1, or +5: all will be included regardless. But, no one is forced to dance unless they're feelin' it. (Watching is real fun too.) These social-dances are all about fun and inclusivity. Both leads and follows are encouraged to ask others to dance. We encourage folks to find new friends and dance partners throughout the night as long as it's consensual. \n\nCODE OF CONDUCT/CONSENT POLICY\nAnyone can ask anyone to dance, and anyone can say no to a dance, for any reason. Please respect each other's decisions, practice consent and have fun! \n\nSKILL MIXER!\nWe encourage mixed skill-levels to dance together in order to form a community of dance-mentors. If you're an experienced dancer, consider learning both the lead and follow part to better help newbies get light on their feet!\n\nNOW AGES 18 & UP!!\nWe're excited to annouce that we're now an 18+ dance, not an all ages dance! We have periodic all-ages square dances. Check our website to keep up on those... \n\n!!!INVITE YOUR FRIENDS!!!\nFun increases exponentially when there's a big'ole mess of people dancing and laughing together. We've had a great turn out the last 3 years of our series- let's keep it up!:", "start_time": "2018-03-12T19:30:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=054ada894a2828852b12018635343097&oe=5B032F58", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 21, "id": "1775504232524801"}, "noreply_count": 10, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T12:04:30+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTE4Mzc4NTM0OTA0MDU0", "before": "MTE4Mzc4NTM0OTA0MDU0"}}, "data": [{"id": "118378534904054", "name": "Square Dance Kalamazoo"}]}, "maybe_count": 217, "place": {"id": "498430240546863", "name": "Bell's Brewery", "location": {"city": "Kalamazoo", "zip": "49007", "country": "United States", "longitude": -85.578847, "state": "MI", "street": "355 E Kalamazoo Ave", "latitude": 42.294803, "located_in": "206257849387824"}}, "end_time": "2018-03-12T23:00:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "Square Dance Kalamazoo", "id": "118378534904054"}, "timezone": "America/Detroit", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "2087913621454858", "name": "Square Dance Kalamazoo 03/12/18!"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c33.0.200.200/p200x200/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=33ac3e6398df9f21e3f672e14adbe2f0&oe=5B24DFBA", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1775504232524801": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=e3c2cddc4d4fbebe4d5e78b5c4770858&oe=5B19414F", "width": 960, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=e5e079b41f065af707462892c738fb6f&oe=5B099A7D", "width": 800, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=70bd6730670f499fdc8260824ddb2a20&oe=5B1EE454", "width": 640, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=d0c6a104535d24e780524551a0253534&oe=5B177813", "width": 426, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=054ada894a2828852b12018635343097&oe=5B032F58", "width": 720, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=947177d8af4b1d55527a30eb8568b9ff&oe=5B0A99F4", "width": 173, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26167226_1775504232524801_6851360308805467817_n.jpg?oh=4d8d68730503dfa980b3d38531e00de6&oe=5B147F43", "width": 300, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1775504232524801", "height": 540}}, "empty": null}
