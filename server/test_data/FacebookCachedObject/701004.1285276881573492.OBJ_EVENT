Movies and flowers are clich\u00e8 and chocolate gives people cavities. Give a real gift- an affordable experience you both will enjoy.\nOr if you're celebrating National Singles Awareness Day instead, come dance with others who are enjoying the same holiday as yourself!\n\nCOST?\nOur dance community believes that learning to dance shouldn't depend on on how much money you have. Pay whatever you can between $5 and $10.\nThat includes an all ages lesson at the beginning followed by hours of social dance.\n\nWHO?\nThis is a weekly event for all level dancers from all backgrounds, as well as entirely new dancers both young and old.\nNO PARTNER NECESSARY!\nIt's an all ages event until 9:30pm, and 18+ until 10:30pm.\n\nWHAT IS BLUES-FUSION?\nIt's an American ballroom style of partner dance that combines the fundamental frame of blues dancing with other styles to create a new aesthetic.\nIt's typically an improvised, lead-follow approach and can often be witnessed in social dance settings like weddings and popular contemporary venues.\nThe music genre varies greatly between dance forums but most fusion prefers a slower tempo that echos it's blues roots.\n\nWHERE?\nWellspring Integrative Wellness Center off of Burnett Rd has been gracious enough to host us in their upstairs studio.\n9144 Burnett Rd SE, Yelm, WA 98597\n\nSCHEDULE?\n7:00pm-7:30pm   |All ages beginners lesson\n7:30pm-9:30pm   |All ages social dance\n9:30pm-10:30pm |18+ social dance\n\nWHY?\nBecause you like to dance. Because your girlfriend or spouse wants you to take her dancing. Because you want to relive the glory days. Because you need to learn to dance before you go to that wedding. Because you're new to town and want to meet new people. There are tons of excuses to come and dance.", "start_time": "2018-02-14T19:00:00-0800", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/27797610_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_o.jpg?oh=ce44fd5250150a2d4c8407ac10063019&oe=5B12CF6A", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "10214613261423814"}, "noreply_count": 360, "updated_time": "2018-02-13T07:51:29+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAyMTE1NDE0Mjk0Mjk5MzQZD", "before": "NDgzNzMyODkxOTk1Mzc3"}}, "data": [{"id": "483732891995377", "name": "Angela Kelly"}, {"id": "10211541429429934", "name": "Matthew R McLellan"}]}, "maybe_count": 29, "place": {"id": "217936198679743", "name": "Wellspring Integrative Wellness Center", "location": {"city": "Yelm", "zip": "98597", "country": "United States", "longitude": -122.627, "state": "WA", "street": "9144 Burnett Rd SE", "latitude": 46.95469}}, "end_time": "2018-02-14T22:00:00-0800", "owner": {"name": "Matthew R McLellan", "id": "10211541429429934"}, "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1285276881573492", "name": "Humpday Blues-Fusion Valentines Dance"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c99.0.200.200/p200x200/27752295_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_n.jpg?oh=9313a8339c0dd1d96f71796b8cf02046&oe=5B0FB2E8", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10214613261423814": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/27797610_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_o.jpg?oh=58127a4457431a9c3d691998d70524db&oe=5B1733B8", "width": 1024, "height": 514}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/27797610_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_o.jpg?oh=3d457004d5fc346210006145068030c3&oe=5B0B1DA8", "width": 956, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/27752295_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_n.jpg?oh=896bab1c0d22892ce22b89ac521f6eff&oe=5B1EB5AD", "width": 638, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27752295_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_n.jpg?oh=e5fbd11956b24a6180a9269d63b97f9f&oe=5B1D02BD", "width": 259, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27752295_10214613261423814_2129310579883560677_n.jpg?oh=dbeb94a987583b1cedce27c48ab4800b&oe=5B17850B", "width": 449, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "10214613261423814", "height": 361}}, "empty": null}
