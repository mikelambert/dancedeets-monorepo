In addition to contra dances in and around the northeast, he has called at various dance camps regionally and nationally.\n\nMuch of his calling activity centers on special occasion \"barn\" dances including the monthly musical event BMAD at his home in Bethany, CT. Other such events include school dances, private parties, special occasions such as weddings, birthdays and anniversaries, and dances in extended care facilities where he has done dances for people using wheel chairs and walkers.\n\nBesides calling, he plays penny whistle and hurdy-gurdy. He has also danced in and played music for performing dance groups in and around the northeast In addition, he calls maypole dances annually in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts. Of late, he is also performing at events playing djembe. Four times a year he hosts ritual gatherings honoring the Solstices and Equinoxes. All of this activity is a manifestation of his commitment to fostering community through dance, music, and ritual.\n\nDinner will be catered by a fellow East Haddam Business Association member. More details to come!\n\nProfits from this event will help kick-off the 2018 East Haddam Farmers' Market Season of events! So, bring your dancing shoes and come prepared for a fun night out! We hope to see you there!", "ticket_uri": "http://coldspringfarmtickets.yapsody.com/", "start_time": "2018-03-24T17:30:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=ad7d22ed0ae7306dcf816d1c48b13222&oe=5B2345A6", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1994964267187609"}, "noreply_count": 491, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T02:26:41+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTc5NTM1Mzc2NDEyNTkxNgZDZD", "before": "NDIyMDE5OTQ0NDgyMDU3"}}, "data": [{"id": "422019944482057", "name": "East Haddam Farmers' Market"}, {"id": "1795353764125916", "name": "Jess Stone"}]}, "maybe_count": 89, "place": {"id": "221977804571285", "name": "East Haddam Grange", "location": {"city": "East Haddam", "zip": "06423", "country": "United States", "longitude": -72.445172667503, "state": "CT", "latitude": 41.479219794273}}, "end_time": "2018-03-24T21:00:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "East Haddam Farmers' Market", "id": "422019944482057"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1930788170572092", "name": "Contra Dance & Dinner On March 24 at Old Town Hall & Grange"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c71.0.200.200/p200x200/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=9096c3e00ae652a25f6f7d0ff4db8a90&oe=5B0C8BFE", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1994964267187609": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=398bb42fee97c69c202a3af2bc04092a&oe=5B21C1D8", "width": 951, "height": 557}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=5a79f68a4e539806107a0a1abc59c14f&oe=5B0AF8C3", "width": 819, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=06375ac50f54f2579eac744396d901e6&oe=5B0EDC84", "width": 546, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=410965268c3a437232780916f77fa918&oe=5B03ECCF", "width": 921, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=3c580057ea3dc91b04c0820a9f81b487&oe=5B1C8563", "width": 221, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26239361_1994964267187609_4894453768986026688_n.jpg?oh=fd6b704c17b15dd4604b6108e155259e&oe=5B25E2D4", "width": 384, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1994964267187609", "height": 421}}, "empty": null}
