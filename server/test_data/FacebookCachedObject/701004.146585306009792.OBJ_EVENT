Starting with a solid rhythmic foundation of guitar and piano, they add inventive twin fiddle harmonies, and finish with juicy, pulsing accordion playing and tasteful percussion. Their tunes are from the British Isles and its relatives \u2013 Ireland, England and Scotland with side trips to Cape Breton and Quebec \u2013 but definitely their own, with an unshakable drive and playful improvisations that make dancers smile.\n\nGaye Fifer has been calling and teaching for many years.
