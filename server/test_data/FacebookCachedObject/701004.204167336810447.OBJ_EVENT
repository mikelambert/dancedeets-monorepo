We will then introduce the steps that are the very essence of the Classic American Tribal Style\u00ae vocabulary; many will seem familiar to practitioners of any form of belly dance, yet we will examine in detail how to execute each one with stylisation specific to ATS. Group improvisation is central to this style and we will begin to uncover the secrets of leading and following; dancing together in duets, trios and quartets and working in unison to create a seamless presentation. Finger cymbals are integral to our fast vocabulary and we will focus on drills and exercises in order to de-mystify and build self-confidence in dancing whilst playing a musical instrument. We will finally expand into the Chorus formation \u2013 duets, trios and quartets on rotation to create a full group performance. The day will culminate with a thorough cool-down in order to re-set our bodies and leave us ready for Day 2!\n\n\nDay 2 \u2013 Advanced Steps and Concepts \nBeginning as before with a full warm-up and conditioning, we will build on Day 1 by adding more complex vocabulary, along with some drills to understand the importance of seamless and elegant transitions. We will next focus on Dynamic Duos and Terrific Trios \u2013 so much fun can be had by expanding on the basic concepts and incorporating alternative formations to add spice to your repertoire and keep your audience on the edge of their seat! Finally, we will come back into our Chorus, to dance all together once more and consolidate everything we have learnt. The intensive will finish with a deep cool-down and relaxation to close our practice.\n\nCharlotte has a wealth of teaching experience including regular weekly classes, local and national workshops and sold-out classes at international festivals. She co-directs ATS\u00ae companies Ter\u2019z\u00edm and TerziMoirai; showcasing both regular small-scale performances and dramatic presentations for big festival stages. She is Sister Studio to FatChanceBellyDance\u00ae of San Francisco, is enrolled in the continuing education programme and is committed to providing quality ATS instruction with a strong technical focus; regularly travelling to train with ATS Masters, FCBD members and the creator of ATS, Carolena Nericcio. She has a passion for health, fitness and anatomy and brings to the classroom her knowledge from her Personal Training qualification and her Integrated Dance training.\n\nDuration: 8 Hour Intensive.\nDates: 24th & 25th of February \nTimes: 11am - 4pm (with an hour for lunch)\nCost: \u20ac100 for the weekend or \u20ac60 per day.\n\nTo book your spot, email us at booking@staceymcpartlin.com", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-02-25T11:00:00+0000", "id": "204167343477113", "end_time": "2018-02-25T16:00:00+0000"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-24T11:00:00+0000", "id": "204167340143780", "end_time": "2018-02-24T16:00:00+0000"}], "start_time": "2018-02-24T11:00:00+0000", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26198246_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_o.jpg?oh=417632156483c9c2a9855a5d97f6d54a&oe=5B1EBC0F", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 31, "id": "1574483279304785"}, "noreply_count": 4, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T07:00:37+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDg1NDg3NjMxNTM3Njk0", "before": "NDg1NDg3NjMxNTM3Njk0"}}, "data": [{"id": "485487631537694", "name": "Stacey McPartlin"}]}, "maybe_count": 67, "place": {"id": "153632168086898", "name": "The Liffey Trust Studios", "location": {"city": "Dublin", "zip": "Dublin 1", "country": "Ireland", "longitude": -6.2301382877626, "street": "117-126 upper sherriff street", "latitude": 53.349728809744}}, "end_time": "2018-02-25T16:00:00+0000", "owner": {"name": "Stacey McPartlin", "id": "485487631537694"}, "timezone": "Europe/Dublin", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "204167336810447", "name": "ATS\u00ae BellyDance Beginners Intensive with Charlotte Wassell"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.8.200.200/p200x200/26166896_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_n.jpg?oh=ee994ab0a6e9eafaea8ca3a538f9d14b&oe=5B08221B", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1574483279304785": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26198246_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_o.jpg?oh=6a4ce58e58f98ff9ee6f556c1accd929&oe=5B1F1B13", "width": 1365, "height": 2048}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p960x960/26198246_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_o.jpg?oh=4de21a241a4b317a8bd5830432794d44&oe=5B06F6C6", "width": 960, "height": 1440}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/26198246_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_o.jpg?oh=10ec2b5555ee1ab23f92cbec8186a5b0&oe=5B09EBDF", "width": 720, "height": 1080}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/26198246_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_o.jpg?oh=0dd5062f08c8bbbf05a8b9f7c5f3371c&oe=5B103C33", "width": 600, "height": 900}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/26198246_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_o.jpg?oh=42093cb1d78a47a6411fceec7dfc7a8a&oe=5B10F41A", "width": 480, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26166896_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_n.jpg?oh=a1affca64a5b6ef2b57ba4c6edfaf158&oe=5B19182E", "width": 320, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/26166896_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_n.jpg?oh=6bc61307d7e60877f0eb356dd2588237&oe=5B19C465", "width": 359, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26166896_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_n.jpg?oh=3aaefc549c8a09ebccfaed7c4909962d&oe=5B1261C9", "width": 130, "height": 195}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26166896_1574483279304785_7504581382973102451_n.jpg?oh=a923bc10eb609091b37cd2efd43f030e&oe=5B1DE07E", "width": 149, "height": 225}], "width": 479, "id": "1574483279304785", "height": 720}}, "empty": null}
