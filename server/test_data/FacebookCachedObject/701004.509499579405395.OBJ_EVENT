Try your luck \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWeather: It will be around 20-25 degrees in April in Bethlehem, but the nights can go as low as 10-15 degrees, as its quite high up. \n\n3. Visa\nIf you are a European or US citizen, you won\u2019t need a visa to come here. You can stay 3 months on a tourist visa. \nBut! Make sure you have a valid passport when you come here! \n\n4. Security in general\nAlthough the West Bank is considered a \u2018conflict region\u2019, there are no security risks for tourists. But stay off from clashes or demonstrations (which can easily turn into clashes). Ask us for any advice or if you have questions about specific issues.\n\n5. Dress code?\nYou can wear what ever you want! Except if you visit holy places. Here it is advised and sometimes required that you wear longish clothes covering elbows and knees sometimes (e.g. in certain mosques) women might be asked to cover their hair, but often scarfs are provided at the door.\n\n6. Money and language\nThe currency used in the occupied Palestinian territories is New Israeli Shekel and spoken Arabic is the local language. But most people will speak and/or understand English.\n\n7. Travel to the festival\nYou can either fly to Tel Aviv (which is probably the easiest and cheapest way to get to Bethlehem) or you can fly to Amman.\nFrom Tel Aviv (Ben Gurion airport) you can take the shuttle to Jerusalem. Get off as close to the old city as possible. From Damascus gate at the old city, there is the bus station for busses to Bethlehem. They go every 15-30 minutes. Busses to the Bethlehem checkpoint run until around 9pm, Busses into to Bethlehem (through Beit Jala) go until about 7pm. \n\n8.
