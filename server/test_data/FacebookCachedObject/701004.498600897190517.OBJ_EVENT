There was a time when we also thought like that. But after a while, we discovered that even though the instructors were good and famous, there was something else that was making an event amazing.\n\nSo we are sure that the reputation of a festival is more important than knowing the teachers and DJ's names. We think that it is more important to go in a place where there are open minded, friendly people, good dancers and organizers working for you!\n\nWe decided NOT to announce the teachers and DJ's team. You will meet them later!\nSo, what can you expect?\n***open heart and friendly people\n***good level of zouk dancers\n***people trust us that we invite good teachers and there are good quality classes\n***DJ team that will bring great atmosphere. Main style is more traditional, but not limited to this - all styles will be played\n***low prices of everything\n***different surprises: shows, free chocolate fountain on Saturday party, etc\n***one day travel next day after the event in some stunning places in Romania.
