The world's premier visionary violinist, Dixon's life mission is to inspire people - and he has done so across North America, including giving three TED talks/performances, over ten years at Burning Man, plus radio, TV, and film appearances.  A former technology leader and symphony violinist, Dixon walked away from a distinguished career to follow his dream full-time, and invented a whole new music genre.  Dixon now improvises on a 5-string electric violin with a looping system he developed to create an all-live one-man symphony, guided by his remarkable personal story of life transformation.  ................
