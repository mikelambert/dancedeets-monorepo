Class time is split between lectures, videos, clothing descriptions/wearing, and dancing.\r\n\r\nJourney Through Egypt 1 is an overview on the movement, posture, clothing, history, and cultural diffusion in the different regions of Egypt. Sahra\u2019s unique perspective follows how the dance transforms from the homes of the people to the sparkling stages of Cairo.\r\nWhile the particulars of every dance, and every bit of culture cannot be conveyed in the 20 hours that make up JtE-1, Sahra strives to present a factual and entertaining overview of the dances of Egypt.\r\nTHE DANCES STUDIED INCLUDE\r\nGhawazee\r\nCairo\r\nSa\u2019idi\r\nNubian\r\nHaggallah\r\nSuez Canal\r\nFellahin\r\nBedouin\r\nThese dances are put into the context of the local culture and histories. Their transformation from homestyle to the stage is also covered in depth. For several of the dances the students break from lecture to stretch their muscles and learn the movements that can traditionally be found in these dances.", "start_time": "2018-03-09T18:00:00-0600", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16939016_289798938103425_5926543988586426446_n.jpg?oh=3337b67f6dd12a7dc8debdb0a5bbe409&oe=5B009327", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 51, "id": "289798938103425"}, "noreply_count": 192, "updated_time": "2018-02-10T08:40:48+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mjc3NDg2NDIyNjY4MDEw", "before": "Mjc3NDg2NDIyNjY4MDEw"}}, "data": [{"id": "277486422668010", "name": "Petite Nadirah"}]}, "maybe_count": 93, "place": {"id": "194364840600594", "name": "Raqs Fusion Bellydance", "location": {"city": "Kirksville", "zip": "63501", "country": "United States", "longitude": -92.5857, "state": "MO", "street": "312 W Washington St", "latitude": 40.19488, "located_in": "181139802022027"}}, "end_time": "2018-03-11T16:00:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Petite Nadirah", "id": "277486422668010"}, "timezone": "America/Chicago", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1452580668108522", "name": "Journey Through Egypt (JTE) 1 in Kirksville, MO!"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c100.0.200.200/p200x200/16939016_289798938103425_5926543988586426446_n.jpg?oh=2e33a3af988ad977efdbf340af558887&oe=5B0E0D45", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"289798938103425": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16939016_289798938103425_5926543988586426446_n.jpg?oh=3337b67f6dd12a7dc8debdb0a5bbe409&oe=5B009327", "width": 480, "height": 240}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/16939016_289798938103425_5926543988586426446_n.jpg?oh=2a2e473c28fea15985ac8af259e81adc&oe=5B0559A9", "width": 260, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/16939016_289798938103425_5926543988586426446_n.jpg?oh=5e3842c8595492dc63e4c358382eb93d&oe=5B22F6DD", "width": 450, "height": 225}], "width": 480, "id": "289798938103425", "height": 240}}, "empty": null}
