Since learning her first steps in Brazilian Zouk five years ago, she studied in Shanghai with Dutch teacher Willemijn Passtoors, and has taken classes from many international teachers. She focuses on technique, especially leading and following. Now she's spreading Brazilian Zouk to Sheffield and beyond!\nMichael discovered Zouk in 2009, becoming one of the first students of Sarah Gibbons & Marcos Fonseca as they brought the smooth styling of Rio Zouk to the London scene. He continued his love & study of the dance in Sydney, Wellington & Auckland when working abroad before coming to Manchester to join the scene here, help build it up and spread the word. A regular attendee of international congresses, Michael enjoys focusing on connection & musicality and helping more people find and fall in love with the dance.\nJenny & Michael have been teaching together for more than a year, bringing their passion for the dance to the Manchester scene and guiding dancers in learning the techniques they need to enjoy Zouk.\n\nWe can't wait to meet you!
