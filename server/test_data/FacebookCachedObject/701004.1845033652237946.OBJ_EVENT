This new weekend is led by a talented young team of Hannah James, Nicola Lyons, and Jim Molyneux, who you\u2019ll get to see in performance on Saturday evening.\n\nBeginners Course: Suitable for people who have never done clog or any kind of percussive dance before. This will mostly be led by Nicola with some sessions by Hannah. Dancers will learn a basic routine and some of the main \u2018building blocks\u2019 of the dance so they can go on to learn more. Clogs will be available to borrow, please let us know she size when booking!\n\nIntermediate/ advanced: Suitable for clog dancers and other percussive dancers who want to learn new steps and take the plunge to start creating their own routines and improvising to music. Dancers will work with Hannah and percussionist Jim Molyneux to look at the relationship between clog and percussion and start dancing like a musician. Hannah has devised a system to help dancers to feel more confident in creating their own steps and improvising on the spot and will give individual help so everyone goes home with a new creation. Participants need to have at least a small repertoire of routines / steps to use as a basis.\n\nWho\u2019s it For?\nSee above! Whether you\u2019re wanting to take your first steps and build your confidence with the basics, or to challenge yourself with new steps and developing your own style, this will be an intensive and fun weekend. Please let us know which course you wish to follow when booking.\n\nThe Team\n\u201cA true original\u2026you need to see James live to fully appreciate her percussive dance skills.\u201d The Guardian\n\nHannah James (Lady Maisery) is a rarity in folk music \u2013 a singer, musician and innovative clog dancer. She has been causing a stir across the folk scene \u2013 in all the right ways \u2013 with her ground breaking project Jig Doll, which combines all of these disciplines in a beautiful new show exploring the life of the travelling player: sometimes exotic, sometimes frightening, it\u2019s a world where home changes daily, and the only touchstones are the skills you carry with you, and the people you meet on the way.\n\n\u201cJigDoll brings to the scene a fresh, hyp- notic and invigorating experience, fusing the old and the new to create something which, while authentically personal, is to be seen as but a staging post in a life of perpetual wide- eyed adventure.\u201d \u2013  Froots Magazine\n\nNicola Lyons is a dancer and fiddle player who began her folk career with the Fosbrooks (directed by Liza Austin-Strange MBE) in Stockport, where from an early age she learned to clog dance in addition to playing both classical violin and folk fiddle. For several years, Nicola was a dancer with The Demon Barbers, which included performances at many of the major UK folk festivals as well as taking part in their acclaimed folk and hip-hop dance show, \u2018Time Gentlemen Please\u2019.\n\nShe is currently a member of alternative folk quartet 4Square who have appeared at many festivals in the UK and Europe, including Fairport\u2019s 2009 Cropredy Convention, before an audience of 20,000. They went on to sell every last copy of their debut album, 20:20 Manchester, becoming The Cropredy Convention\u2019s 2nd biggest selling band of all time!\n\nJim Molyneux studied at Chetham\u2019s School of Music, and the Royal Northern College of Music. He is the co-founder of 4Square (with Nicola) and also a member of the \u201cgenre-busting cinematic folk septet\u201d The Fair Rain (formerly The Old Dance School).\n\nIn 2008 Jim made it to the Grand Final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year, televised on BBC2 to 1.1 million viewers!\n\nPricing\nFull board per person (tuition, activities, tutor's gig, all meals & accommodation):\n\n\u00a3232 \u2013 single ensuite room\n\u00a3206 \u2013 sharing an ensuite room\n\u00a3206 \u2013 single non-ensuite room\n\u00a3160 \u2013 sharing non-ensuite room\nCamping per person (tuition, activities, tutor's gig, all meals) - \u00a3149\nNon Resident (tuition, activities, tutor's gig, all meals except breakfast) - \u00a3139", "ticket_uri": "https://halswaymanor.org.uk/event/clog-and-percussive-dance-weekend/", "start_time": "2018-06-01T16:00:00+0100", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26814914_1586937001375159_5869211642777743190_n.jpg?oh=d418f8e9cb57d9e0d179df0db02becd0&oe=5B114A4F", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1586937001375159"}, "noreply_count": 0, "updated_time": "2018-01-17T12:16:26+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MjcwNDg4NTk5Njg2Njc5", "before": "MjcwNDg4NTk5Njg2Njc5"}}, "data": [{"id": "270488599686679", "name": "Halsway Manor"}]}, "maybe_count": 7, "place": {"id": "270488599686679", "name": "Halsway Manor", "location": {"city": "Crowcombe", "zip": "TA4 4BD", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -3.2504081726074, "street": "Halsway Manor, Halsway Lane, near Crowcombe", "latitude": 51.136708969496}}, "end_time": "2018-06-03T16:00:00+0100", "owner": {"name": "Halsway Manor", "id": "270488599686679"}, "timezone": "Europe/London", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1845033652237946", "name": "Clog and Percussive Dance Weekend"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c78.0.200.200/p200x200/26814914_1586937001375159_5869211642777743190_n.jpg?oh=ee635bc753b076f805bf915fc5f2a7be&oe=5B09A29A", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1586937001375159": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26814914_1586937001375159_5869211642777743190_n.jpg?oh=d418f8e9cb57d9e0d179df0db02becd0&oe=5B114A4F", "width": 672, "height": 378}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26814914_1586937001375159_5869211642777743190_n.jpg?oh=ac378e27c5b1221498020a1103898c8d&oe=5B18E413", "width": 568, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26814914_1586937001375159_5869211642777743190_n.jpg?oh=cb7f401400b3a7fdb5c7c81285dff79a&oe=5B08DBF4", "width": 231, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26814914_1586937001375159_5869211642777743190_n.jpg?oh=2bc7d115e2cd6d6ad8f259e4a465d724&oe=5B0C6443", "width": 400, "height": 225}], "width": 672, "id": "1586937001375159", "height": 378}}, "empty": null}
