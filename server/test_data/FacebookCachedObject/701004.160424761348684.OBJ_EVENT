It is a dance that is simply mesmerizing to dance, and to watch. As Zouk can be danced to a wide variety of musical genres, it is ever-changing and always dynamic. The dance requires the ultimate trust and connection between partners, as dancers surrender themselves to the music, and each other.\n\nBecause the dance is dynamic, leaders and followers must have good control over their movements, and great balance - something that will be worked on in class. Beside understanding connection and momentum, steps and movements, dancers must also work on building their strength and control, to be able to enjoy their dances in a safe and respectable manner.\n\nIn this 2-hr x 4-lesson course, I will be introducing you to the fundamentals of Zouk. Using a variety of exercises, you will learn all about dance posture, breathing, connection, weight control, moving with your body, as well as the foundational steps of Brazilian Zouk.\n\nThe lessons will be fun, and yet challenging. The exercises will marry fun with work. At the end of the day, the greatest reward you will get is seeing how you can connect with influence another individual, through the language of dance.\n\nThe gift of Zouk, is like no other. Join us and experience it for yourself.\n\nCourse dates:\n---------------------------------------\nWed 14, 21, 28 Feb, 7 Mar 2018, 730pm to 930pm\n\nFees:\n$160 for first-timers.
