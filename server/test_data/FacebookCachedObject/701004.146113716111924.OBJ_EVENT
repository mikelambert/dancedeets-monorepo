He is one of the founders of an organization known either as FICA (in Brazil, an acronym for Funda\u00e7ao Internacional de Capoeira de Angola) or ICAF (in English, this stands for the International Capoeira Angola Foundation). \n\nMestre Cobra Mansa is well known in the world of Capoeira. He started Capoeira in 1973 with Mestre Josias da Silva and Raimundo in the Rio neighborhood of Duque de Caxias. He played Capoeira in the Duque Caxias street rodas and was one of the founders of the Caxias Street Roda with Mestre Rogerio Russo and Peixinho de Capias. In 1974 Cobra Mansa became a student of Mestre Moraes after he saw Mestre Moraes play in the Roda of Central Brazil. In 1981 he went to Salvador and started the organization and school, GCAP (Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelorinho) in Salvador with Mestre Moraes.\n\nIn 1995, the International Capoeira Angola Foundation was founded by Mestre Cobra Mansa, with its headquarters in Washington, DC. Together with Mestre Jurandir Nascimento and Mestre Valmir Damasceno, Mestre Cobra Mansa has expanded ICAF to create an international Capoeira Angola community with affiliate schools in the United States, Brazil, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nCobra Mansa has researched all aspects of Capoeira Angola, from its origins in Africa through its turbulent history in Brazil. He has interviewed and videotaped many of the old masters in an effort to accurately understand and document the events leading up to the present. He is now a leading expert, not just on Capoeira, but on the berimbau (the musical bow), the Black Movement, and African martial arts, and holds a bachelors degree in physical education.\n\nFor more information: http://www.kilombotenonde.com/ingles/kilombo-tenonde/cobra-mansa-1/", "start_time": "2018-03-30T11:30:00+0700", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=10e446c476fe51517281b843490c0916&oe=5B1EEE58", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "10155358720532634"}, "noreply_count": 34, "updated_time": "2018-02-01T02:30:54+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MjgyMTQ5NzQ4NzIw", "before": "MjgyMTQ5NzQ4NzIw"}}, "data": [{"id": "282149748720", "name": "International Capoeira Angola Foundation - Bangkok"}]}, "maybe_count": 87, "place": {"id": "381494815241250", "name": "14 October 73 Memorial", "location": {"latitude": 13.756432104141, "city": "Bangkok", "zip": "10200", "longitude": 100.50064663761, "country": "Thailand"}}, "end_time": "2018-04-01T17:00:00+0700", "owner": {"name": "International Capoeira Angola Foundation - Bangkok", "id": "282149748720"}, "timezone": "Asia/Bangkok", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "146113716111924", "name": "3rd International Capoeira Angola Encounter"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c0.41.200.200/p200x200/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=ffd20ed1c529adca95a9fa3fc149d01e&oe=5B1F21AE", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"10155358720532634": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=5debe3ad37441670ee0c7e0e66125185&oe=5B0C89B3", "width": 679, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p600x600/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=f9944c4105dc5b14790bd8014f3fdc1e&oe=5B1BEC7C", "width": 600, "height": 848}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=bfd250cb07ec0e76306be03768d5f034&oe=5B1A8E46", "width": 480, "height": 678}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=e186351810f2f6dfe739f37af8913ebc&oe=5B0FAC04", "width": 320, "height": 452}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=8e96af47a9df0ff72ed22e63f79d22ef&oe=5B23B421", "width": 381, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=0583f2a5e012f5df65e7d6fe96d7a495&oe=5B0B3314", "width": 130, "height": 183}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27332154_10155358720532634_3998928475090111227_n.jpg?oh=4fa6c6537fecf2e879e1cdebf6e9d160&oe=5ADBC6A2", "width": 159, "height": 225}], "width": 509, "id": "10155358720532634", "height": 720}}, "empty": null}
