It's an opportunity for movement, connecting, creating art together, and meaningful conversations. Most of all, it's about having a space of our own to play and learn.\n\nExpect about 1/3 contra dancing, 1/3 making things together & sharing skills, and 1/3 conversations that matter.\n\nHosted at Camp Chimney Corners in Becket, Massachusetts, a lovely locale, the weekend of May 18 - 20, 2018, this weekend has intentionally limited attendance - only 115 spots.\n\nCaller: Gaye Fifer!\nBand: Anadama!\n\nGo to www.formtheocean.com to join our email list to be the first to know (and get early bird goodness) and stay tuned here for exciting news to come...\n\nREGISTRATION:\nRegister through April 2018 at $325.

FMI: https://www.formtheocean.com/financial-request-form\n\nFAQ:\n**So, what do you mean by \"women\"?\nWe mean the biggest definition ever. This party is meant for folks who hear \u201cwomen\u2019s retreat\u201d and think, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a space for me.\u201d It's meant for folks who identify as female, non-binary, genderfluid, genderqueer, trans*, and/or femme.\n\n**Why a women's only weekend?\nWe know we're not alone in craving more spaces to hang out with other women. We know the power of dancing together, creating together and sharing skills, of having deeper conversations - risky conversations - and coming out the other side stronger. And we know the confidence that comes from having that group who gets us, and meets us with compassion, encouragement, insight, and glee. That's why we created this weekend. \n\nWe want you to leave this weekend feeling more connected to the national contra dance community of women and more able to meet the needs of your communities, your body, and your spirit.\n\n**Who is performing?\nWe have spectacular all female talent - to be annouced starting in August! Stay tuned. It's good!\n\n**I don't contra dance, but this sounds like something I'd love to do. Can I come?\nIf you don't contra dance, you're totally invited. We\u2019ll have plenty of folks to teach you how it\u2019s done! Or, you can enjoy the many other offerings - like the stellar music, the art-making, the dialogue, and the friendships.", "ticket_uri": "http://formtheocean.com/", "start_time": "2018-05-18T17:00:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26951912_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_o.jpg?oh=ac274ca47a270d65cd1bdfe3aee728c0&oe=5ADA30F1", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1766528186751132"}, "noreply_count": 748, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T15:51:48+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxMDAzNzI1MTI2OTQ1NzUZD", "before": "ODg2MTQxMTcxNDU2NTA5"}}, "data": [{"id": "886141171456509", "name": "Dela Here"}, {"id": "10202858510360699", "name": "Gabrielle Lanza"}, {"id": "10204625539972659", "name": "Kristen Planeaux"}, {"id": "10100372512694575", "name": "Avia Moore"}]}, "maybe_count": 274, "place": {"id": "104328189607387", "name": "Camp Chimney Corners, MA", "location": {"latitude": 42.280279, "city": "Camp Chimney Corners", "state": "MA", "longitude": -73.073494, "country": "United States"}}, "end_time": "2018-05-20T18:00:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "Dela Here", "id": "886141171456509"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "328667254252485", "name": "Form the Ocean: A Women's Contra Dance & Creative Retreat"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q84/c78.0.200.200/p200x200/26734474_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_n.jpg?oh=ed25d226a902e934154a4d8145e35801&oe=5B0B059B", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1766528186751132": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26951912_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_o.jpg?oh=0848ab0021ca032b5f7e27803f7aa132&oe=5ADACBED", "width": 2048, "height": 1152}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p960x960/26951912_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_o.jpg?oh=8b173000c25fc95685945230889d3ceb&oe=5B130C38", "width": 1706, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/26951912_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_o.jpg?oh=a408557f2bbf9a7ac236889d3a96b486&oe=5B0EF421", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/26951912_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_o.jpg?oh=e336c7f41f6f32da19d0bd70ae0b70d7&oe=5B1F64CD", "width": 1066, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/26951912_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_o.jpg?oh=ac88cb70902efae6bf8de5e6d5eb7fdb&oe=5B1EA8E4", "width": 853, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q84/p320x320/26734474_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_n.jpg?oh=3f023c012de98c4afc0bffaf4536bd01&oe=5B0BB063", "width": 568, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/26734474_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_n.jpg?oh=8055b7c36aa9e3e6770e4c3b9d43d722&oe=5B1386C4", "width": 960, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q84/p130x130/26734474_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_n.jpg?oh=70d63d54b6d8d81fcf28d96e67aaf594&oe=5B202384", "width": 231, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q84/p75x225/26734474_1766528186751132_3486257068993230118_n.jpg?oh=61c96a01a347cf5e297f47be1029dde3&oe=5B04D2F4", "width": 400, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1766528186751132", "height": 405}}, "empty": null}
