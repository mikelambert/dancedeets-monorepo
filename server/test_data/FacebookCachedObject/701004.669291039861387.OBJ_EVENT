Covers and fusion are twins at heart - at their core lies something established and familiar, but they both come alive as we breathe new inspiration into them. \nWe love finding the unexpected in something familiar, and this month's Melting Pot will do just that with an evening full of remade classics. \n\nThese DJs are always looking for new covers - if you have a favorite, feel free to send it to them! Who knows - you might just hear it at Melting Pot.\n\nClass: 7-8pm - Tybaldt Ulrich\n\"Play with Cross Step Waltz\"\nCross Step Waltz is a fun, creative traveling dance.  We will learn to play with patterns that travel around the floor; putting Promenades, Twinkles, and Fallaways into your fusion dancing.  Not just for 3/4 or 6/8, we'll take our patterns off-grid and dance them to all types of music!  \n\nTybaldt Ulrich has been dancing and teaching since the mid 90\u2019s.  he spent a bit of time on the competitive circuit, becoming a champion in West Coast Swing and Hustle, and has had the pleasure of learning from many great teachers and performing in Lindy, WCS, Carolina Shag, Balboa, Houston Whip, Hustle, Argentine Tango, New York Salsa, International Ballroom, Country 2Step, and Zouk.  A degree in Ethnomusicology, a diverse dance background, and respect for creativity of people and the continually evolving dance community are his tools to help you get more out of your dancing.\n\n---------------------------------\nMP Schedule:\n7:00-8:00pm Class with Tybaldt Ulrich \n8:00-11:30pm Music by DJ's Kathleen & Sabrina\n\nSLIDING SCALE: We want to keep MP as cheap as possible for everyone! Sending an extra dollar or two our way will mean we can do more things for this event in the future. \n\n$10-$15 Sliding Scale for the dance\n$10 for the class\n\n**If you want to get in free by Volunteering, private message Rachael Bansemer\n\n------------------\nFusion Dance NYC is proud to host a social dance with a true \"Melting Pot\" of different partner dance forms and musical genres. \n\nThe Music:\nWe play a variety of music, starting with a baseline of electronic sounds (easy to be creative with because it is not associated with any other dance form), and depending on the night may or may not include..... Pop, Blues, Acoustic, WCS, Alt Tango, Zouk, Classical, Jazz, and whatever else we cook up :-)\n\nThe Dancing: \nWe use the many genres of partner dance to create personal, improvisational expressions of music.\nTo us, this means breaking down the boundaries between dance forms to allow us to pick and choose which amongst the many different techniques we wish to employ at any given time. It also means bringing the partner dance community together under one roof to help foster endless possibilities of movement creation.\nWatch videos of fusion dance here:\nhttp://flouerdances.com/fusion\n\n-------------\nQuestions & Concerns:\nWe are dedicated to helping you be bold while maintaining safety on the dance floor.
