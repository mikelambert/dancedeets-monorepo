'folk' is us, the people and 'lore' is our cultures, stories, traditions and knowledge passed down from generation to generation so It's created by the people for the people which means it is for everyone the everyday folk, for anyone who wants to learn. \nOne of the aspects which distinguishes Capoeira from other art forms is the fact that Capoeira is accompanied to live music. \nAs music is 'played' and shared so is Capoeira. The nature of playing and sharing in capoeira not only develops body/movement intelligence, it stimulates psychosomatic connection and between our mind/body increasing body awareness, rhythm and Proprioception. \nThe sharing of this interaction between mind/body and music/instruments in collaboration with others develops a better understanding of yourself and empathy towards others. \n\nMovement, Beyond Steps and Form. \n\nAcross the world, humans and their cultures have always combined work and song. \nWhether it was hunters on the way to or back from a hunt, villagers washing clothes, armies marching, field workers working/harvesting the land, dock workers (Stevedores*longshoremen) pushing, carrying, pulling, loading and unloading goods on and off ships, fishermen rowing or pulling in their nets, railroad workers/labourers digging and hammering rails to sleepers, work and song has always accompanied each other to celebrate or to tell stories of the past, call and response dialogue to communicate ideas, hidden messages between people and ancestors (deities/gods) or \nProvide a rhythm, coordinating timing to unify workers to work in harmony \nOr to help transform the mundane and ordinary into play and transcend.\n\nFor some years now I have found my self being drawn and inquiring into the mystical and transcendental experiences I have had while moving and playing Capoeira.\n\nThis quest has led me on an inner journey and exploration through different spiritual arts and practices which I have found to have similar themes and rituals.\n\nThrough the Capoeira experience. \nWe will explore the worlds of \u2018work\u2019, \u2018rhythm\u2019 and \u2018song\u2019 and how they relate to each other, how does work turn to play? Can we playfully work? and\nmore importantly how this knowledge can help not only develop our awareness and personal practice but our day to day lives.  \n\n***\n\nAbout Baris \n\nBaris is a Teacher, Manual therapist and for many years has worked as a performer.\nCurrently Baris leads a module on Capoeira he has coined as \u2018Movement Semantics\u2019 as part of BA (HONS) dance: Urban Practice at the University of East London.
