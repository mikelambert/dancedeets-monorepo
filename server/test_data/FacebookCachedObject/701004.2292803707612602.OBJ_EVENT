All the groups are run in a way that the group puts its needs forwards and then the group leaders design the programming according to what the needs in the group are. This way the \u201cwhat\u201d of what the men\u2019s Circle/jams will be determined through group process organically. I.e. if many men are feeling overwhelmed by the \u201cme to movement\u201d and what that means for CI then programming will be designed to support them in that. If men want to discuss and practice how to listen to whether some is consenting to a shoulder lift than programming will be designed around that. If the men want to jam together then that is what will be done. \n\nFACILITATORS:\nVivek Patel has been teaching and facilitating groups in different capacities for 25 years. In the mid-90s he was the national facilitator trainer for Canadian Crossroads International, an international development organization. He designed and facilitated weekend long groups that were designed to prepare participants for the realities of overseas volunteer work. They also focused heavily on social justice issues. There was also a weekend for returned volunteers which dealt with the emotional experience of re-entry. He also designed and facilitated a 10-day residential facilitator training program. He was in this role for just over 11 years. He has taught martial arts for 15 years and contact improv for 10. He also ran a contact improv based dance company from 2006-2008. \n\nPaul Lewis has been dancing contact improv for the last three years, and recently was on stage in the role of Therapist in Kathleen Rae\u2019s Men\u2019s Circle. They became aware of anti-oppressive practices during yoga instructor training five years ago.  Group process work and intersectionality has been common threads in volunteering and study for 20+ years.\n\nSUPPORTED BY:\nORJC Grant Fund and REAson d'etre dance productions and pay-by-donation of attendees\n\nPRODUCED BY:\nVivek Patel and REAson d\"etre dance productions", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-04-25T20:45:00-0400", "id": "2292803724279267", "end_time": "2018-04-25T22:15:00-0400"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-28T20:45:00-0400", "id": "2292803717612601", "end_time": "2018-03-28T22:15:00-0400"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-28T20:45:00-0500", "id": "2292803720945934", "end_time": "2018-02-28T22:15:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-31T20:45:00-0500", "id": "2292803714279268", "end_time": "2018-01-31T22:15:00-0500"}], "start_time": "2018-01-31T20:45:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26910894_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_o.jpg?oh=75c0d974d19229ce59237d7e5fb3e76c&oe=5B16951E", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 51, "id": "1394908710637527"}, "noreply_count": 38, "updated_time": "2018-02-04T23:43:41+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTI0MzY1NTM1NTY3OTEZD", "before": "MjQyNTY5ODQ1ODcxNDI1"}}, "data": [{"id": "242569845871425", "name": "REAson d'etre dance productions"}, {"id": "10152436553556791", "name": "Vivek Patel"}]}, "maybe_count": 17, "place": {"name": "805 Dovercourt Rd, Toronto, ON M6H 2X4, Canada"}, "end_time": "2018-04-25T22:15:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "REAson d'etre dance productions", "id": "242569845871425"}, "timezone": "America/Toronto", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "2292803707612602", "name": "Wednesday Men's Contact Improv Jam and Circle"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c101.0.200.200/p200x200/26907118_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_n.jpg?oh=7f411fbd7417b1f1fe7c01ee36ba9442&oe=5B0BFFFA", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1394908710637527": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26910894_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_o.jpg?oh=669f29212e603ec204351a5462367709&oe=5B1ED502", "width": 1000, "height": 498}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/26910894_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_o.jpg?oh=31c389a8d27059a11668ae6bd4b6b6ff&oe=5B24C20B", "width": 963, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p320x320/26910894_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_o.jpg?oh=57aed7b16b4b3d21516cc2aafbda6625&oe=5B02D94C", "width": 642, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26907118_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_n.jpg?oh=f98d9d0984cb216a16b8936d2c54939f&oe=5B22C1AD", "width": 261, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26907118_1394908710637527_6839021716043616778_n.jpg?oh=8a256266ef10906d0231c4656bed67e9&oe=5B1F341A", "width": 451, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1394908710637527", "height": 358}}, "empty": null}
