With veteran lead player Rebekah Geller (13) on fiddle, dad (and experienced jazz guitarist) Michael Raitzyk, older brother Jakob Raitzyk (18) on fiddle and foot percussion, and mom Judith Geller on french horn, The Organic Family Band carries on musical traditions and brings new life into the sound of dance/folk music.\n\nAlso, to add to the evening's fun, is a caller we all love, Dean Snipes, the original \"mighty fine\" caller who engages us with his humor and wit as he clearly teaches the lesson and calls the dances. Spontaneous hilarity breaks out at times as Dean corrals we sometimes inattentive dancers as we socialize and talk. It is humorous when we accidentally mess up during the dance and Dean has to get us back in line. That's why contra is some much fun - its something we can do and not have to worry about doing right, enjoying the freedom to make mistakes, knowing that no one cares!\n\n- No partner necessary, No experience necessary\n- If you can walk, you can contra dance \n- If new, join in the fun lesson at 7:30\n- Bring clean, soft soled shoes with you to change into to protect floors\n- Bring friends for more fun!\n- Community dancing for all ages\n- High energy, live music\n- Everyone makes mistakes but nobody cares\n- The more you do it, the easier and more fun it becomes\n- Treat one another with care and respect, smile and have a good time\n\nGeneral admission $9  (Members $8)\nFull time students 23 and under $6  (Members $5)\n \nFREE Lesson 7:30 - 8\nDance 8 - 10:30 pm with short break in middle\n\nClemmons Civic Club\nExit 184 from I-40\n2870 Middlebrook Drive, Clemmons, NC\n\nFiddle & Bow Country Dancers Website:   www.FeetRetreat.com\nFollow us on our Facebook Page: Fiddle and Bow Country Dancers\nJoin our Facebook Group: Fiddle and Bow Contra Dancers\n\nFiddle & Bow Country Dancers is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.", "start_time": "2018-03-13T20:00:00-0400", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/27749786_1804234909646534_992220181292343351_n.jpg?oh=f5dc8eae2727c86a3cab8ad11cd1c53a&oe=5B178C49", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1804234909646534"}, "noreply_count": 50, "updated_time": "2018-02-07T19:27:38+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "ODQzODIxODA1Njg3ODU0", "before": "ODQzODIxODA1Njg3ODU0"}}, "data": [{"id": "843821805687854", "name": "Fiddle and Bow Country Dancers"}]}, "maybe_count": 16, "place": {"id": "115655088457630", "name": "Clemmons Civic Club", "location": {"city": "Clemmons", "zip": "27012", "country": "United States", "longitude": -80.38282, "state": "NC", "street": "2870  Middlebrook Dr", "latitude": 36.01962}}, "end_time": "2018-03-13T23:00:00-0400", "owner": {"name": "Fiddle and Bow Country Dancers", "id": "843821805687854"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1443595622418232", "name": "Contra Dance Clemmons"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c78.0.200.200/p200x200/27749786_1804234909646534_992220181292343351_n.jpg?oh=44eed9a420061a462a33298755a33560&oe=5B0D9A85", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1804234909646534": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27749786_1804234909646534_992220181292343351_n.jpg?oh=8d93b6921c0ff27bd97735743463c4a8&oe=5B1EE32B", "width": 816, "height": 459}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/27749786_1804234909646534_992220181292343351_n.jpg?oh=39aa1b30c770bdac1bba818e388813dc&oe=5B0EE5CA", "width": 568, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/27749786_1804234909646534_992220181292343351_n.jpg?oh=68d51b7b9f813aa481248bdce79b62a4&oe=5B2658A5", "width": 231, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/27749786_1804234909646534_992220181292343351_n.jpg?oh=eab88251d0e007e91cb6b9ff07180734&oe=5B089BD1", "width": 400, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1804234909646534", "height": 405}}, "empty": null}
