I really do believe this dance offers so much of beauty and awareness, and love, and passion, and understanding of relationships, supporting, and caring..  it's really beautiful..  because we can slow down the movements that we can really be present and have that opportunity to be aware.  \n\nWe will start with simple walking, walking together, understanding and having compassion for as leader and follower, each other. \ninvitation, how to answer to the invitations, to be present!!  \nOchos, cross!!  pausing, how to listen to the music (the music offers a lot of freedom how to interpret them and how to express them into your own feelings)  well, we will start simple..\n\nYou need to bring yourself, if there is a friend who wants to join you, great!  but it's only you that's even better!!  If you are a couple who wants to do this together, remember to be patient with each other, because everyone needs some time to develop to be an awesome dancers, especially as a Tango dancers..  as a couple, each person  wants to put out the best of themselves to each other, but I think the real people will show their weak sides, and undeveloped sides;  the real love and patience, encouragements to support each other to build each other!!  I think that's really the real relationships goals.  No Matter what we love and support each other!!  \n\n$65/person, $125/couple  6 weeks of 75 min Argentine Tango Class\n\nIf you are really interest please messages me, so that I can sign you in the class.\nPlease share this message to others!!  We are trying to grow our Tango community here!!  \nThank you!\n\nShiwa Noh\nshiwa317@gmail.com\n(917) 579-8443", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-02-13T18:15:00-0500", "id": "314721825708034", "end_time": "2018-02-13T19:30:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-06T18:15:00-0500", "id": "314721812374702", "end_time": "2018-02-06T19:30:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-30T18:15:00-0500", "id": "314721815708035", "end_time": "2018-01-30T19:30:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-23T18:15:00-0500", "id": "314721819041368", "end_time": "2018-01-23T19:30:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-16T18:15:00-0500", "id": "314721809041369", "end_time": "2018-01-16T19:30:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-09T18:15:00-0500", "id": "314721822374701", "end_time": "2018-01-09T19:30:00-0500"}], "start_time": "2018-01-09T18:15:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26197716_1381031752006609_3454009323424244712_o.jpg?oh=581c723e7d8b94b5e3cff4624c21d299&oe=5B06B2A8", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "id": "1381031752006609"}, "noreply_count": 39, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T07:35:48+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTgwNDg5NDY4NzI3NTE2", "before": "MTgwNDg5NDY4NzI3NTE2"}}, "data": [{"id": "180489468727516", "name": "Noh Way School"}]}, "maybe_count": 19, "place": {"id": "180489468727516", "name": "Noh Way School", "location": {"city": "Bangor", "zip": "04401", "country": "United States", "longitude": -68.77067, "state": "ME", "street": "170 Park St", "latitude": 44.80519}}, "end_time": "2018-02-13T19:30:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "Noh Way School", "id": "180489468727516"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "314721802374703", "name": "New Beg.
