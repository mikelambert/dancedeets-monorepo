Be The Temple is emotional deep, juicy, enlivening, and spiritually nurturing - both an introduction to the transformational, ecstatic healing power of Sensual Embodied Awakening Bellydance, and a delicious recharge to shine ever more brightly in the world. \n\nWe will start with some gentle guided movement and a relaxed inquiry into the deep well of wisdom that lives and breathes as the body Temple. With sensitive guidance and inspired narrative, bellydance teacher and embodied awakening guide Tara Harper will invite us through mystical doorways that we will hold open with our intention for the imaginal realms to appear. The intention is to be available for the Mystery beyond the veils of illusion to dance us awake.\n\nWe will explore the simple Sacred Shapes of bellydance in order to raise our vibrational intelligence to release habits of body, mind and emotion, and to rejuvenate in the currents of bliss. The Sacred Shapes of Bellydance awaken different aspects of the universal energies and are similar to energy cultivation practices such as chi gung, tai chi or yoga.\n\nThis work is sacred, so please think about how you can arrive in a way that will honor your own sense of divinity. Come comfortable, fresh, fre,e and in a spirit of welcoming the highest potentials for yourself, for each other, and for the greater worlds.
