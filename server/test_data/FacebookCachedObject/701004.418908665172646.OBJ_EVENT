Other activities will include jams, potlucks, and spontaneous surprises. We want to get to know you\u2014your treasures, your idiosyncrasies, your distinctive pathways into contact improvisation. \nAttending a weeklong training allows the group to establish working relationships, and provides the opportunity for everyone to receive feedback and create significant changes in their dancing\nBecause of the advanced nature of this workshop, this intensive is for those with a solid grasp of Contact fundamentals. \n\nMartin's teaching history and website is here: http://martinkeogh.com/my-story/\n\nCost for the Intensive (June 18th-24th)\n$420 - Economically deprived, students and underemployed. \n$455 - Economically challenged: artists, farmers etc..\n$495 - Professional rate: Happily sustained, supports the art.\n\nPlease note that food is NOT included in the Intensive.\nYou can sign up for a meal plan for 165$ for a total of 12 meals. 5 breakfast, 5 lunches and 2 dinners. \n\n*Discount if you take part in the whole Plunge (June 18th-July 1st) \nhttps://www.contactimprovisationsaltspring.com/registration/\n\n*Please note that we are not taking part-timers in the intensive or the festival.\n\nLink to festival event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/145060062768260/\nRegistrations and Questions: ssicontactfestival@gmail.com\n\n(P.S.
