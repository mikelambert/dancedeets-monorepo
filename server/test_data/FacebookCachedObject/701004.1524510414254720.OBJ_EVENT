Boise Avenue\nAdults: $10 (youth ages 10-18 are half price)\n\nWhat is Contra Dancing?\nContra Dancing is a form of American folk dance in which the dancers form a set of two parallel lines which run the length of the hall. Each dance consists of a sequence of moves that ends with couples having progressed one position up or down the set. As the sequence is repeated, a couple will eventually dance with every other couple in the set.\n\nWhat if I Have Never Danced Before?\nIn Contra Dancing, your feet are never asked to do more than walk to the music. Each dance is taught by the caller before it is danced. The caller continues to prompt the dancers as needed. Because the pattern of moves of each Contra Dance is repeated often, Contra Dances are easy to learn. Both beginning and experienced dancers happily share the same set.\n\nWhat if I Don't Have a Partner?\nNo problem. Many people come to a Contra Dance alone. Dancers are encouraged to dance with many different partners throughout the evening. If there is an excess of one gender, it is customary for women to dance men's parts (and vice versa) to form couples and extend the set.\n\nDo I Need to Wear Special Clothes?\nNo. Contra Dancers tend to dress informally. Most people dress for comfort and in anticipation of vigorous exercise. Ladies prefer loose, light dresses or skirts; men wear lightweight slacks, jeans, or even shorts. Be sure to wear soft-soled, comfortable shoes.\n\nWhat is the Music Like?\nFor many dancers, the live music is the great attraction. Traditional jigs, reels, and hornpipes from the Scots-Irish tradition on both sides of the Atlantic form the basic repertoire. The fiddle is often the lead instrument.", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-05-12T19:30:00-0600", "id": "1524510447588050", "end_time": "2018-05-12T22:00:00-0600"}, {"start_time": "2018-04-14T19:30:00-0600", "id": "1524510424254719", "end_time": "2018-04-14T22:00:00-0600"}, {"start_time": "2018-03-10T19:30:00-0700", "id": "1524510434254718", "end_time": "2018-03-10T22:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-10T19:30:00-0700", "id": "1524510437588051", "end_time": "2018-02-10T22:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-13T19:30:00-0700", "id": "1524510427588052", "end_time": "2018-01-13T22:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2017-12-09T19:30:00-0700", "id": "1524510430921385", "end_time": "2017-12-09T22:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2017-11-11T19:30:00-0700", "id": "1524510440921384", "end_time": "2017-11-11T22:00:00-0700"}, {"start_time": "2017-10-14T19:30:00-0600", "id": "1524510444254717", "end_time": "2017-10-14T22:00:00-0600"}, {"start_time": "2017-09-09T19:30:00-0600", "id": "1524510450921383", "end_time": "2017-09-09T22:00:00-0600"}], "start_time": "2017-09-09T19:30:00-0600", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/21433034_836619823129776_1120994240314716345_n.jpg?oh=3fe362c60ad35d0198f9c5585a054c2e&oe=5B21F68E", "offset_x": 50, "offset_y": 0, "id": "836619823129776"}, "noreply_count": 2, "updated_time": "2017-09-09T19:40:15+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTgyMTQ4Mjg4NTc2OTM2", "before": "MTgyMTQ4Mjg4NTc2OTM2"}}, "data": [{"id": "182148288576936", "name": "Boise Contra Dance Society"}]}, "maybe_count": 37, "place": {"id": "468699646520458", "name": "Broadway Dance and Event Center", "location": {"city": "Boise", "zip": "83706", "country": "United States", "longitude": -116.17257, "state": "ID", "street": "893 E Boise Ave", "latitude": 43.57785}}, "end_time": "2018-05-12T22:00:00-0600", "owner": {"name": "Boise Contra Dance Society", "id": "182148288576936"}, "timezone": "America/Boise", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "1524510414254720", "name": "Contra Dance"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c170.0.200.200/p200x200/21433034_836619823129776_1120994240314716345_n.jpg?oh=fb4699f89adf11deb53f8386f522c57d&oe=5B062EE0", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"836619823129776": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/21433034_836619823129776_1120994240314716345_n.jpg?oh=d92c594d2b03cdf8b35b6f626270c68f&oe=5B0A30EC", "width": 851, "height": 315}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/21433034_836619823129776_1120994240314716345_n.jpg?oh=366da3426b30cfcd840afb88bb4f22e3&oe=5AD82462", "width": 351, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/21433034_836619823129776_1120994240314716345_n.jpg?oh=901e63a7abd6dca4bf9c437d24b89e52&oe=5B1D7916", "width": 607, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "836619823129776", "height": 266}}, "empty": null}
