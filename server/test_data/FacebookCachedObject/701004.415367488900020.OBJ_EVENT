{"info": {"is_page_owned": true, "attending_count": 4, "declined_count": 0, "description": "Developed in collaboration with Jennifer Freeman, PT (practicing and research faculty at Mercer University in Atlanta) this workshop focuses on safe progressions to go from the ground to the air in an inversion, and from inverting on two arms to one arm. The workshop includes a movement screen, a investigation into good body mechanics, and different functional training tools, exercises, and techniques to get your butt over your head. \n\nThis clinic will include both teaching cues and training tools beneficial for anyone from a beginner wishing to deepen their understanding to coaches interested in learning how to recognize when a student is displaying signs of potential movement dysfunction. Students are strongly encouraged to bring pen/paper or something they can take notes with.\n\nPREREQ: Anyone is welcome as it is primarily a theory-based workshop (and anyone can watch and learn), though it is strongly encouraged attendees have two arm inversions with straight arms (or at least inversions of any kind) as the majority of content is focused around going from 2-arm to 1-arm inversions.", "start_time": "2018-02-16T18:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/26758671_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_o.jpg?oh=99067e48fcf45b70f4badc56409098a7&oe=5B14C99D", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 55, "id": "876030205891745"}, "noreply_count": 0, "updated_time": "2018-01-17T18:01:58+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAyNjc0OTY5ODkzOTQz", "before": "MTYzMjkwMDk5MDExNDc0OAZDZD"}}, "data": [{"id": "1632900990114748", "name": "Aaron Koz"}, {"id": "102674969893943", "name": "The Ann Arbor Aviary"}]}, "maybe_count": 18, "place": {"id": "102674969893943", "name": "The Ann Arbor Aviary", "location": {"city": "Ann Arbor", "zip": "48104", "country": "United States", "longitude": -83.734531402588, "state": "MI", "street": "2875 Boardwalk Dr, Suite A", "latitude": 42.246389687389}}, "end_time": "2018-02-16T20:30:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "The Ann Arbor Aviary", "id": "102674969893943"}, "timezone": "America/Detroit", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "415367488900020", "name": "Inversion Clinic"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c29.0.200.200/p200x200/26734165_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_n.jpg?oh=19e565c9b07c13231686773a5f6e4819&oe=5B1F3367", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"876030205891745": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/26758671_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_o.jpg?oh=b1801acd8575de6acb8e234461b26b12&oe=5B16A908", "width": 1199, "height": 927}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/26758671_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_o.jpg?oh=9881bb84f7b64b79dd11cf019c53984b&oe=5B0AA48E", "width": 931, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/26758671_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_o.jpg?oh=65aa0f2dbb41c025a95fa869f0f9ef51&oe=5AD9679B", "width": 776, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/26734165_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_n.jpg?oh=3baef121a1acad0fb66786c88e66f336&oe=5B1C359D", "width": 621, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/26734165_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_n.jpg?oh=3af3cbd78d9e8ce4289783ac956996bb&oe=5B100BC7", "width": 414, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/26758671_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_o.jpg?oh=12ad6aa358af080458a197c8ba04f548&oe=5B0E6D9C", "width": 698, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/26734165_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_n.jpg?oh=f447ea66c5b0eecc4dd375160a78e2ee&oe=5B2217A8", "width": 168, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/26734165_876030205891745_2768893303627641370_n.jpg?oh=ba5d6d9c266869cee7744ecb815b9161&oe=5B1127DC", "width": 291, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "876030205891745", "height": 556}}, "empty": null}
