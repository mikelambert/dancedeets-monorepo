Guess so did the huge groups during the two consecutive Contact-Meets-Contemporary festivals which he mesmerized with his work. \r\nCome, it will be great! \r\n\r\nBunch of words from Yaniv:\r\nAfter having had such rich visits to Germany at CMC festival 2015-16, i am super excited to teach here again, this time with a special focus, that has been a huge source of inspiration and information these past few years.\r\n\r\nWater\r\nBack in the 60's, German scientist - Theodor Schwank was exploring and making scientific observations of moving water and air. He wrote a very beautiful book named \"Das chaos sensible\". All he did was observe and try small interventions to see how\r\nwater function, organise and interact in the world. He then found ways to speak about it that were scientific enough but very imaginative and reflective.\r\nDiving into his book as well as lots of fresh research about water, i have been flooded with new ideas and sensations, which i continue to explore still with great joy and fascination.\r\n\r\nShortly, water act in 3 main areas:\r\n1. circulation- delivering and exchanging material between earth and its' environment, as well as moving living material around the planet.\r\n2. sensory- recieving and projecting every little cosmic or earthly event, by vibrations and waves.\r\n3. pulsating- a giant rythmic organ, connectiong the earth to the cosmic \"time-line\" of events.\r\n\r\nIn CI water also has the keys to the understanding of - spirals, falling/flying, taking weight, structural organisation (and disorganisation!!), moving together, and the shifting of states. Water generally has all a dancer needs:))\r\n\r\nThings i hope to explore with you\r\n- sensing gravity and \"center of the earth\"\r\n- undoing effort and accumilated tension in the body\r\n- spiraling and continous disorganisation (refreshing the chaos:)\r\n- traveling with weight instead of lifting or carrying\r\n- floating, flying, falling and suspending (as ways of relating to gravity)\r\n- wave motion and formations\r\n- developing very subtle \"ears\", relaxing into small sensations with a body ready to fly\r\n\r\nI would like to encourage the graceful chaos in each one of us, allowing for all ranges of movement, with effeciency and playfulness. Sounds perfect no?
