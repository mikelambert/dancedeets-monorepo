He has always been a lover of music and dance, so when he was shown the beauty, fluidity, and techniques of Brazilian zouk he couldn\u2019t resist. Now after 3 years and many hours of training under District Zouk, taking private lessons with some of the best international instructors, and participating in and dancing at congresses throughout the northwest US, he's looking forward to helping spread the passion and knowledge he has for this amazing art form that is dance.\n\nVanessa Scott found zouk in New Zealand and was drawn to its music, fluidity and circular movement. When she lived in the midwest US, she persuaded a ballroom teacher to go half on DVDs and learn Zouk from scratch together. About two years ago Vanessa moved to the DMV area and has been zouking as much as possible ever since.  She joined the District Zouk dance team and has performed with them for two years.  This year she went to the first ever 30-day Rio Zouk Immersion Course in Brazil where she studied with top world instructors Jaime Ar\u00f4xa, Renata Pe\u00e7anha, Brenda Carvalho and Anderson Mendes da Rocha. Working closely with them in such an intimate setting allowed her to see the depth of zouk and differentiate between different philosophies.  This December Vanessa just completed a 40-hour personal training with Xandy Liberato in Spain. She has enjoyed traveling the world soaking up different flavors of zouk and is excited to share her passion and knowledge with others.\n\nDistrict Zouk\u2019s mission is to offer regular opportunities to learn and dance Brazilian zouk, and to nurture and grow the Brazilian zouk community in DC.  Ashley and Valentine co-founded District Zouk with Amy Abbott and Bianca Desroches, and they have been teaching weekly Brazilian zouk classes at DanceSport Dupont Circle since June 2014, as well as organizing workshops and other events. District Zouk received an award at the New York Zouk Festival in October 2017 for their contributions to zouk in North America.\n\nFor some examples of what this dance looks like, check out:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/DistrictZouk/videos/", "event_times": [{"start_time": "2018-02-13T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2053113331574199", "end_time": "2018-02-13T20:15:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-02-06T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2053113314907534", "end_time": "2018-02-06T20:15:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-30T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2053113321574200", "end_time": "2018-01-30T20:15:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-23T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2053113318240867", "end_time": "2018-01-23T20:15:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-16T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2053113324907533", "end_time": "2018-01-16T20:15:00-0500"}, {"start_time": "2018-01-09T19:00:00-0500", "id": "2053113328240866", "end_time": "2018-01-09T20:15:00-0500"}], "start_time": "2018-01-09T19:00:00-0500", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=5029b1b04a410420a0749500a7635f8a&oe=5B0F32D4", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0, "id": "1563183113765500"}, "noreply_count": 104, "updated_time": "2018-02-09T20:41:38+0000", "admins": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTI0NjM2NjY1NDA3NzgZD", "before": "NzAzODYyNTcyOTczOTYy"}}, "data": [{"id": "703862572973962", "name": "DanceSport DuPont Circle"}, {"id": "635489349868219", "name": "District Zouk"}, {"id": "10152463666540778", "name": "Jamiel Roberson"}]}, "maybe_count": 137, "place": {"id": "703862572973962", "name": "DanceSport DuPont Circle", "location": {"city": "Washington", "zip": "20037", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.049252911054, "state": "DC", "street": "2201 P St NW", "latitude": 38.910391774197, "located_in": "120265392438"}}, "end_time": "2018-02-13T20:15:00-0500", "owner": {"name": "District Zouk", "id": "635489349868219"}, "timezone": "America/New_York", "is_canceled": false, "type": "public", "id": "2053113311574201", "name": "Brazilian Zouk Fundamentals (Level 1): 6-Week Series in January"}, "picture": {"data": {"url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c50.0.200.200/p200x200/25550562_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_n.jpg?oh=678488b775da8d0455f003daf287d2f7&oe=5B0BB89C", "width": 200, "is_silhouette": false, "height": 200}}, "cover_info": {"1563183113765500": {"images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=1485ae741ae41c8fb385f91586181aa1&oe=5B2057DD", "width": 2048, "height": 1366}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p960x960/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=15ca285cde280b7dd818c6d29cffa598&oe=5B059408", "width": 1439, "height": 960}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/p720x720/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=d9aad9998183b3f2ede2a5eeb9a2eae8&oe=5B148011", "width": 1079, "height": 720}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p600x600/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=c06e480208c010ffda12ee297c8985d5&oe=5B07E4FD", "width": 899, "height": 600}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=5029b1b04a410420a0749500a7635f8a&oe=5B0F32D4", "width": 719, "height": 480}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p320x320/25550562_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_n.jpg?oh=12c84f2c29f7e0da254640d9588d85ec&oe=5B0D3E2F", "width": 480, "height": 320}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/25586916_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_o.jpg?oh=5c698dd8fc72c1b39753320712ebea6b&oe=5B1672D8", "width": 809, "height": 540}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/25550562_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_n.jpg?oh=2d8f3737324201deb8f3504d09b835df&oe=5B1081C8", "width": 195, "height": 130}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p75x225/25550562_1563183113765500_8391476357063421566_n.jpg?oh=898a750d26be3a8745f2de9033e622f5&oe=5B17177F", "width": 337, "height": 225}], "width": 720, "id": "1563183113765500", "height": 480}}, "empty": null}
