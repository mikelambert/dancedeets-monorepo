Brazilian zouk is derived from the older dance Lambada, and Lambazouk is the style that is closest to the original Lambada. The characteristics of Lambazouk are smooth circular movements, high energy, head movements (advanced level) and lots of alegria (joy)! Welcome to join us in the world of pure Brazilian joy with a lot of dance, fun, laughter and a lot of inspirational dances!\n\nThe intensive Lambazouk courses each consist of 90 min of classes including the practica on 2,5 h each session during 6 weeks. The extended classes aim to give our students deeper knowledge and more time for practising the sequences!\n\n*SCHEDULE* starts Sunday 4th of March\n\n17.00-18.30 \u2013 Workshops 2 levels - Beginners & Interm./advanced\n18.30-21.00 \u2013 Brazilian Zouk Practica \u2013 Zuper Zouk Zunday\n\nWe are looking forward seeing old and new students!\n\n*BEGINNERS COURSE*\nThe beginners course is an introduction to Brazilian Zouk where you will learn the fundamentals of the dance. We work through not only the basic steps, turns and movements of Zouk, but also focus on technique and connection. No head movements are taught in the beginners course, as it is crucial to understand the basic technique, which can help you later on to advance in the movements and also to develop skills in related dances such as traditional Zouk, West Coast Swing and Bachata. The beginners course we teach an \u201dall-around\u201d- style with focus on the basics, frame and rhythm. \n\n*INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED COURSE*\nIn this course we work through more advanced movements and variations of Lambazouk, such as bamboleo, cambr\u00e9s and munheca. We work more in detail with the flow of the movements and show you creative variations of them. You will also get a deeper knowledge of the characteristiques of Lambazouk, but also differences in styles. One class will be dedicated to musicality. A minimum of 1 year regular dancing/courses is required to attend this course. \n\n*REGISTRATION* \nRegistration is made to: info@brazouka.com\n\n*PRICES & OFFERS*\nEARLY BIRD PRICE: 900 kr (payment made BEFORE course start)\nAT DOOR: 1000 kr\nOnly practica: 60 kr (included in course fee)\n*1 workshop: 200 kr\n9 h of classes and 15 h of social dance is included in the course fee, in total 24 h of dancing!\n\n\u2605OFFERS FOR BEGINNERS\u2605\n20% discount if you sign on spot the 28/1\n10% discount if you sign until the 15/2\n\n\u2605OFFERS FOR CURRENT STUDENTS\u2605\nIf you are current student and recruit a beginner student you get further 200 kr discount on the course fee.\n\nPAYMENTS are made to:\nBG: 543-3016 \nSWISH: 123 555 73 68\nAdd your last name and level of course in the description field.\n\n*About BRAZOUKA STOCKHOLM*\nBrazouka Stockholm is the oldest dance school in Stockholm specialized in the Brazilian couple dance Zouk/Lambazouk.
