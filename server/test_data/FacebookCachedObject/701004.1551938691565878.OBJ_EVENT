One-trick pony shows get old, so mix it up and add depth to your performance with unique footwork and traveling patterns to use your space creatively!+++\n\n+++1:30pm- 2:30pm ($25)  Rhythm is a Dancer! : Cymbals, Steps and Combinations with Alana Mari\n\n         In this fun workshop we will look at some of my current favorite rhythms and some fun combos with finger cymbal patterns to couple with them. I\u2019ll be sharing combos which center around vintage, folkloric, and earthy steps, with explanation, styling and posturing that keeps the ATS/fusion dancer in mind. Through learning some combos the central focus of this workshop will be learning to effectively and beautifully interact with the rhythms. Don\u2019t forget to bring your finger cymbals because we are going to play music with our hands as well as our hips.\n\nBeginner students are encouraged to play finger cymbals, but may choose to forgo them. Intermediate or Advanced belly dance students: have your finger cymbals with you for this class OR arrange to borrow a pair from me or a friend.\nMaterials: Finger Cymbals, Optional: Quiet hip wrap/belt notebook.\nA music resource will be available for students of this workshop after class.+++\n\n+++2:45pm- 4:15pm ($30) Improv Toolkit with Amy Danielson\n\n        When you think of dance, do you jump for joy, but need to polish your improv skills? When the music comes on and you have no choreo planned, do you drift toward the wall like a shy violet? Let's get over the improv barrier once and for all! This workshop will contain the elements you need to be the dancing queen you know you have inside. Learn movement connectors, confidence builders, and breakthrough exercises to get you on the road to being able to dance any time you want, with confidence.+++\n\n+++4:30pm- 5:30pm ($25)  Taking Flight- Isis Wings with Alora\n\n        Come learn how to fly!
