This vinyl and digital release captures Hidden in all its glory \u2013 dangerous, unrelenting techno that is uncut and unsweetened. Plankton lets loose with the title track \u201cEdding\u201d and follows up with three more commanding originals, \u201cKaloff\u201d,\u201cSloping\u201d, and \u201cTurnal\u201d - that will help in shaping dance floors by keeping the party at it\u2019s peak. In true Hidden Recordings fashion, a techno luminary is called upon to add more power to an already action-packed release. This time, UK heavyweight and techno leading light Mark Broom completes the release with a splendid remix of \u201cEdding\u201d that is nothing short of awe-inspiring and sure to be the talk on every DJ\u2019s lips this Spring.\n\nTRACK DESCRIPTIONS:\n\nEdding (Original)\nPounding with flexing drums and rich bass sound that show no mercy for souls on the dance floor. Sweeping sounds throughout add an element of chaos and energy that are indisputable. The track is an relentless force and aimed at creating a raw, sweaty late-night vibe.\n\nEdding (Mark Broom Remix)\nThere are few names as important and consistent in techno than Mark Broom and he\ufffc delivers a masterpiece that goes beyond exceptional. The remix is comprised of giant walls of drummy techno meeting deep, big hall filling melodies that is quintessential Broom, leaving listeners in absolute bliss from its sublime groove.\n\nSloping\nA punchy, forward-thinking track immersed by an over-riding deep bass sound that is prominent motif on this release. The track builds nicely with tension created by slight volume variations to pads and synths throughout, complete with well-timed and dramatic releases to ensure the chaos stays in full swing on the dance floor.\n\nKaloff\nA darker industrial and menacing track that is designed for the fearless in the DJ booth and on the dance floor. A constant driving vibe will push those to exceed their limits as the track continuously builds and releases tension throughout using full and dramatic sounds, frequencies and dominant drums.\n\nTurnal\nA gift for those sets entering the twilight, Turnal is a deep, glitched out tech beast that caters to those discerning DJs looking for something special.
